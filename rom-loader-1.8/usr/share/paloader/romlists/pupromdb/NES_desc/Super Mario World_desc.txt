Super Mario World is probably the most sought after and hardest to find of any Famicom pirate. There are allegedly two version of it. The first is a single game cartridge, like this one, where the game starts on the first world. The second version, found on multi-carts, starts with a level select option. Some say it's only this second version that is complete, containing all the levels.

This version of Super Mario World starts you out with 15 lives, and for a Hong Kong original, is incredible. It's probably the most fun you'll have with any pirate because it's both challenging and free of many of the glitches you see in other originals and hacks. That doesn't mean it doesn't have glitches, of course, but they're minimal.

Don't expect for this to be the SNES version of Super Mario World! Many collectors make the mistake of expecting too much from this port, because when it gets right down to it, it's nothing like the original. But it's challenging, and even though you start with 15 lives, you'll soon find those dwindled down to only a few.

Expect to pay about $60 for this. You're lucky to find it at all, much less for a reasonable price. If you can find one for less than $60, consider yourself lucky.
