So you think you're hot stuff because you single-handedly won the war for us in the Persian Gulf? Well, that's going to feel like it was child's play after you get a look at your next mission.

In TOP GUN - The Second Mission, you'll be going up against a ruthless legion of planes, tanks, ships, and satellites that'll be firing missiles, cannon bursts, and anti-aircraft fire that have your name written all over them! You'd better master those Low-G YoYos, Immelman Turns, and Split-S Turns if you hope to survive out there. If you're not ready to take on an entire army by yourself, go head-to-head with a friend in some hardcore dogfighting action. Either way, you'll need to keep your cool if you're going to survive remember, this is not and exercise!
