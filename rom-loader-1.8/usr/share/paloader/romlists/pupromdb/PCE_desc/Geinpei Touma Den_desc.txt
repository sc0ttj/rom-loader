The Japanese predecessor to Samurai Ghost. This game, however is a little different that the later version (also known as "Genpei Toramaden - Volume 2"). There are three different types of screens to play, there is the normal kind (which is your basic "platform" type run/jump/slash game).

There is also a larger version of this (which is used through out SG), and then there is also an overhead version of the first. As you make your way through each stage, you may find yourself falling down a pit to an overhead "area," and often times, these will have several stage endings, so that your path doesn't always follow the same way.
