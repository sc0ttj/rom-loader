How would you like to have the best arm in football? You can... all 28 NFL teams. Over 100 real offensive plays and over 50 defensive plays. Battery back-up to save your stats. Design your own plays, team and your own season! Go head-to-head or be the coach. Super smooth animation and life-like stadium sound. Real weather conditions that affect your game play. Troy's a back-to-back Super Bowl champion quarterback. Can you be one?

Gameplay:

Troy Aikman NFL Football is an Atari Jaguar, Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis American football video game where players can play exhibition matches, season matches, playoff matches, make their own plays for use on the field, and even pays salaries to his players. Each season schedule can either be customized (to the player's exact specifications) or the player can use the schedule from the 1993 NFL season. There is limited voice capability with the referee having a vocabulary of less than 10 words. In newer games, both the referee and the announcer would have a combined vocabulary of more than 1000 different words and nicknames for the players.

Aikman is the first member of the 1993 Dallas Cowboys to have his namesake in a game. Emmitt Smith was the second Dallas Cowboys member to have his own game titled Emmitt Smith Football; that game was released 14 months after Aikman's game.
