First, you choose whether to play as Mickey or Minnie, and then you choose from three difficulty levels. The player then learns of trouble in Beanswick. There is a strange rumbling over the castle and no one can explain it. Mickey (or Minnie) volunteers to investigate. He must go through a series of challenges in various rooms of the castle in order to collect magic beans and items. These tasks can be completed in any order, but all must be finished to beat the game.
