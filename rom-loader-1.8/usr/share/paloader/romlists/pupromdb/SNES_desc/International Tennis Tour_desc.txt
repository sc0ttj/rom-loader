International Tennis Tour is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Microsoft Windows video game about tennis and being an international superstar. There are practice, exhibition, and career mode where the player is given a generous number of dollars and must compete on the world tennis circuit in order to gain more money. The player can only play as a male tennis player, even though tennis was one of the few sports deemed acceptable for women to play in the "olden days."
