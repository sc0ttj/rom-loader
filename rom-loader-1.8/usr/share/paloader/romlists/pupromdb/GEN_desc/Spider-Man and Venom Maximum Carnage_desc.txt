Only one maniacal madman can force Spider-Man to unite with his sinister, arch-nemesis Venom: CARNAGE! His deadly rampage is tearing New York City apart! Only wild web-slinging maneuvers, crushing combat moves and Super Hero allies can save the city from total obliteration! It's maximum mayhem! It's Maximum Carnage! Paint the town red!

Gameplay:

In this single-player side-scrolling beat 'em up (with a format similar to Final Fight, Streets of Rage, and De-Cap Attack) the player controls Spider-Man (but in some levels have the option to play as Venom) through various levels in an effort to stop the supervillain Carnage and his gang, as well as hundreds of criminals they inspire in their wake, from taking over the city. The two 16-bit versions are identical.
One of the game's comic-styled cutscenes.

Spider-Man's wallcrawling plays an important part in the game. It can be used to find secret items, temporarily escape from difficult enemies and is even the basis for the second level.

The other Marvel heroes can be summoned by collecting appropriate items hidden within certain levels. Their effects vary greatly, and some of them have different effects depending on who the player is. Of note is the rarity and set locations of the power-ups necessary to summon aid, and that each character has a unique set of music to accompany their appearance.

In order of appearance, the other characters and their powers:

    - Cloak stops all movement and removes all enemies on screen.

    - Black Cat (for Spider-Man) hits all enemies on screen, (for Venom) lands on one enemy and hits all enemies between herself and the far edge of the screen.

    - Dagger hits all enemies, but the animation differs between Spider-Man and Venom.

    - Firestar (for Venom) blasts all on ground enemies, (for Spider-Man) hits all enemies (aerial enemies included).

    - Spider-Man/Venom (depending on the player character) fires the Sonic Gun.

    - Morbius the Living Vampire (for Spider-Man) distracts all enemies, (for Venom) reduces all enemies to low health.

    - Deathlok hits all enemies on screen.

    - Iron Fist (for Spider-Man) completely heals him, (for Venom) kicks all enemies on screen.

    - Captain America throws his shield, (for Venom)often hitting only one or zero enemies.(for Spider-Man) Hits all Enemies.

It should be noted the damage they inflict is considerably lessened for the super-villains (especially Cloak's power, for example,) farther into the game. The effect of the heroes on villains can vary depending on the character used against. Spider-Man's Morbius, for example is useless against bosses. Black Cat is a terrible choice to kill Carrion because he flies. Conversely though, certain heroes can have dramatic effects on some villains. For example, Firestar and Spider-Man/Venom deal considerable damage to Carnage (It is noted in the game that Carnage and Venom both are extremely susceptible to fire and/or sonic blasts). Also, the use of the Sonic Gun while in control of Venom is more harmful to Venom than Carnage as you continue on later into the game. This is due to the fact that at this time in the story, Carnage has developed an immunity to Sonic weapons, while Venom has not.

Hints:

- Knock Bosses Out Quickly; Gain Life and Continue -
If you double-smash a pair of non-superpowered bosses without punching or kicking either of them beforehand, you can instantly knock them out. Doing so will also get you an extra life and continue.
To double-smash, have Spider-Man/Venom exactly between your two targets, and shoot a web.

- Secret Statue of Liberty Level -
This will enable you to access the secret Statue of Liberty Level. When Venom is tied up and above the fire, press the 'B' and 'C' buttons rapidly while Carnage is talking to have Venom attack the Sonic Gun, and Gain access to the Secret Level.
