Fight to expand your territory and eventually unite all of China.

In this edition of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, you have the option of Historical mode, or Fictional mode. In Fictional mode the generals are randomly placed and you an create your own characters, while in Historical mode all the leaders are based on historical figures and tied to certain cities.

Vast improvements were made over the graphics of RTK 2, as well as slight changes to the interface, commands and tactics. RTK 3 is the only version that includes a strong component of naval warfare.

Overall, one of the strongest titles in a truly great progression of classic games.

Gameplay:

Upon starting the game, players choose from one of six scenarios that determine the initial layout of power in ancient China. The scenarios loosely depict allegiances and warlord holdings in the novel, although gameplay does not follow events after the game begins:

    - Dong Zhuo's rivals unite (189 A.D.)
    - The chaotic era begins (194 A.D.)
    - Cao Cao's power expands (201 A.D.)
    - Zhuge Liang plots strategy (208 A.D.)
    - Liu Bei builds Shu kingdom (221 A.D.)
    - Three kingdoms fight decay (235 A.D.)

After choosing the scenario, players determine which warlord(s) they will control. Custom characters may be inserted into territories unoccupied by other forces, as well. A total of 41 different provinces exist, as well as hundreds of unique characters. Each character has several statistics (War ability, Intelligence, Politics, Army Command, Naval Command, Charisma), which range from 1 to 100.

The goal of the game is to conquer China. This is accomplished by holding every province on the map.
