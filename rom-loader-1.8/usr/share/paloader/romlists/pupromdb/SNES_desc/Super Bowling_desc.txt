Four computer opponents are available, two female and two male. There are three modes: Golf, Normal, and Practice where the player constructs his own scenarios and practices knocking down the bowling pins with either 1 or 2 balls.

The SNES version takes place in a bowling alley during the late 1950s, even though the characters use late 1980s/early 1990s adolescent slang words.
