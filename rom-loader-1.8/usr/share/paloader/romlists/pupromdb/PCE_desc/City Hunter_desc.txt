Rather old PCE title based on the anime of the same name. You assume the role of Ryou Saeba, "City Hunter." A Private Investigator who really knows how to take care of business. Unless there's a good looking woman around. Then he's a pervert. Who would have guessed?

Anyhow, you control Ryou around 4 different stages: an office building, another building, a warehouse and a cruise liner. As you advance, you will collect different weapons (you start of with a pistol, and can get a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher and a laser gun). After you have completed the first three scenes (in any order), you move onto the last one.

What is a stage, well, you run around (back and forth), killing bad guys, climb and descend stairs (and occasionally jump over something). Doors are peppered everywhere, some lead to other parts of the "scene," others have people behind them who can help you (either with information, items, health, or guns), and each stage has a "SEXY GIRL" who will "heal" Ryou (hey, that's how they're listed in the game credits!).
