The game still had all of Tecmo's revolutionary features (breaking tackles), but now teamed with the NFL Players Association, the game had names for nearly all of its players, with a few players still under generic names (Like WR Niners). The game also added a new feature, Player Trades. Gamers were allowed to trade for four weeks before the season. For the first time, Jerry Rice could play for the Cowboys, or Deion Sanders could play for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The game was somewhat well known when it was released, but now, the game is relatively rare.
