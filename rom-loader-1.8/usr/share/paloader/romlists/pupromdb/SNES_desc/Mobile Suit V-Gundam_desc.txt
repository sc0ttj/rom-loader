I'm not sure if you can call this a game.

This is another Gundam game, but unlike its brethren, this is not a strategy game, but more of a side-scrolling adventure. Except you can barely control your mech, you have very limited ammo, you can't jump, you only have a flimsy shield to protect yourself, and oh yeah, two enemy mechs will come at you from both sides, so even if you're defending your front, your back is wide open.

No pun intended there, folks, but that's what happened to me. I had a forcible entry expert there.

In short, I don't like this game. The end.

...

Well okay, the graphics are pretty.

Translation Description:

This one looks to be finally complete with some nice hacking work from RedComet. Enjoy some 100% complete V Gundam action.
