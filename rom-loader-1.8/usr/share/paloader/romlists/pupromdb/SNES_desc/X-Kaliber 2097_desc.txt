X-Kaliber 2097's American soundtrack was arranged by 90s electronic/industrial music group Psykosonik. Psykosonik's soundtrack became an unusually large part of the game's marketing, and was often plugged in marketing blurbs. The soundtrack is also mentioned on the game packaging, and has its own section in the game manual.

In X-Kaliber 2097, the player guides a swordsman named Slash through a side-scrolling environment. Boss encounters take place as one-on-one matches in the style of versus fighting games.
