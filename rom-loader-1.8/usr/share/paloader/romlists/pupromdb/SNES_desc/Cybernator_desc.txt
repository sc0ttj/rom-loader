THE GUTS AND BOLTS OF A MECHANIZED MARINE

The Cybernator first appeared around 2013 AD. Initially introduced as a means of eradicating space pirates from the lunar shipping route, the Cybernator soon became an integral part of the marine corps' mechanized forces, replacing the Firestorm XG-9 Solar Tank.

Becoming an elite Cybernator warrior requires 1,000 hours of training in mock Cybernator combat. Ninety percent of all marines who attempt to take their seat in the Cybernator cockpit either drop out because of mental and physical fatigue, or are accidentally destroyed by their own incompetence.

The Napalm Gun
To get the Napalm Gun, all you have to do is complete the first level WITHOUT SHOOTING ANYTHING EXECPT THE BOSS OF THE LEVEL. However, you DO have to complete one more task before it stays with you for the whole game: you MUST complete level 2 WITHOUT DYING. If you can complete level 2 without dying, the congratulate yourself on a job well done; you now have the most powerful weapon in the game.
