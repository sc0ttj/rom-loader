It's all here - the strategy, the challenge, the competition and the pageantry of the Winter Games. Compete against a friend or take on the computer in four completely realistic and action-packed events. Choose the country you want to represent. Then practice, train and develop the winning strategy for each competition... Speed Skating in a grueling race on ice. Hot Dog Aerials for daredevils on skis. Figure Skating to test balance, stamina and precision. Bobsled, where every screaming turn could mean the difference between wiping out and winning gold. Your adrenaline and heart are racing. Let the games begin!

A snow-and-ice themed follow-up to the highly successful Summer Games, Winter Games was released in 1986 for the Commodore 64 and later ported to several popular home computers and video game consoles of the 1980s.

The game was presented as a virtual multi-sport carnival called the "Epyx Winter Games" (there was no official IOC licensing in place) with up to 8 players each choosing a country to represent, and then taking turns competing in various events to try for a medal.
