Setting

The game's story takes place in a typical medieval fantasy world. It bears incredible resemblance to Ireland.


Gameplay

The game differs from most other RPGs in that the experience system is not based upon a traditional "level-up" model. Instead, experience is gained for specific stats based on how the player performs in battle. If the character gets hit a lot, for instance, defense will increase. Also, whenever the player finds a wispy white spirit, they can choose an element of magic to upgrade (from Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind). Leveling up these elements grants the character new attacks and strengthens existing ones.

The game has no money system. Every item is either found in a treasure chest, given to the player character free of charge, or dropped by a monster, if the character doesn't have one already. If the character runs out of HP, the game will return him to the last inn at which he saved. He will be allowed to retain all spells, items, and experience he has gained before death, but he may decline to do so by resetting the game without saving, and in any case, any items used before death will not be returned.


Development

The game was first previewed at Space World in 1997 under the working title Eltale (エルテイル) as its name.

Because North American and PAL releases of the game were considered too short and too easy, Imagineer added new events and tightened some of the repetitive gameplay for the game's Japanese localization
