Hang-on is a classic eighties racing game, originally bundled with the Master System and reminiscent of Pole position, but with bikes. You race against the time, battling an unlimited amount of opponents on a highway. While the clock ticks down, you maneuver past your opponents and try to steer clear of obstacles on the side of the road. Beating the clock extends your time and draws a new backdrop for you to race in.
