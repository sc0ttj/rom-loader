After generations of being under the stifling rule of the Evilonian Empire, a successful raid on the Empire's armory has put the world's most powerful weapon in the hands of the Earthlings. The SYVALION Attack Fighter is a high-powered machine that has been unstoppable in the past, and now it's time for the Evilons to get a taste of their own medicine. As a top-notch pilot, you've been selected to fly the Syvalion and undertake the most important mission of your life: destroy the Evilon Battlestar. In three different modes of play, you'll have to master the difficult controls of the alien attack fighter if you're going to be successful. Luckily, you've got a wide range of weapons at your disposal and a 360-degree firing radius, so most of the time your enemies will never know what him 'em. So, strap yourself in and save the Earth in SYVALION.
