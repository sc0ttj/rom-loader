Lucky Luke is a Franco-Belgian comics series created by Morris, the original artist, and saw its best period written by Ren? Goscinny. Set in the American Old West, it stars the titular character, Lucky Luke, the cowboy known to shoot faster than his shadow.

Along with The Adventures of Tintin and Asterix, Lucky Luke is one of the most popular and best-selling comic-book series in continental Europe, but unlike Tintin and Ast?rix, despite its popularity in Canada, only a minority of the series' adventures have been translated into English.
