"A near perfect port of the VS arcade version."

Excitebike was originally released as an arcade game in 1984, and eventually ended up on the Nintendo Famicom home console. The home console version was not quite as faithful to to the VS arcade version. This updated port for the Famicom Disk System version is more true to the arcade version, and includes a bit extra. This enhanced version was never released outside Japan.

Story - 6/10
The original arcade version didn't really feature a story and neither does the FDS version, it's basically a motorcycle stunt race where you must qualify in each event to pass through to the next round.

Presentation/Graphics - 7/10
The game's presentation isn't like the arcade version but it presents a nice and colourful title screen that looks pleasing. The menu options are easy to navigate and are in English despite being a Japanese game.

The game's visuals are on par with the original Famicom version and the intermission and reward scenes are faithfully adapted from the Vs version. The visuals are of the quality seen in many first generation Famicom titles - basic colors and uncomplicated track design.

Gameplay - 8/10
The game is a side scrolling motorcycle stunt race viewed on a 2.5 degree playfield. Move your bike vertically across the playfield while advancing and negotiating jumps, ramps, dirt traps and avoiding the other racers. The game consists of solo time trial events where you must make the qualifying time by yourself, then replay the track with up to 6 other competitors on screen. The games difficulty gradually increases as you advance. Some bonus stages are scattered throughout where you must jump over train carriages.

Apart from making it across the jumps you must carefully monitor your bikes temperature gauge. When riding in turbo speed you temp gage can overheat if you're not careful and you lose valuable time waiting for the engine to cool down. The alternate acceleration mode is slower but prevents the engine overheating. There are indicators on the track that will cool down the temp when you ride over them, but you can save a lot of steam by letting got of the accelerator all together when flying mid-aim after jumping off a ramp.

The other racers will get in your way but you can knock them off by cutting across them and hitting their front tires. This can also happen to you and you'll get knocked off and lose race time.

Multiplayer - 5/10
The game features the original arcade gameplay with alternate 2 player mode, and a new VS battle mode with split screen gameplay. Both players compete in a vertically split screen race, that can be decided by a number of rounds on various courses. Best lap times can be saved to the disk.

Control - 9/10
Nothing really problematic here, the control is as sharp on the Famicom controller as it was with the arcade sticks.

Soundtrack/Audio - 7/10
The game features all of the tunes from the arcade version with a small remix thanks to the Famicom Disk System's added sound channels. A nice selection of mellow tunes like that of many other Nintendo classics. The sound effects are the same as in the arcade and cartridge versions - the monotonous hum of the motorcycles, the odd jump noises and the scratchy crash sounds.

Replayability - 6/10
If you played the game many times at the arcades and were disappointed with the home cartridge conversion, the Disk System port is on par with added 2 player goodness. The game is a rare find on eBay, but it's surely great for import game collectors.

Race your way to stardom, or build your own track and challenge your friends to beat your best time! Excite Bike was my favorite game for a better part of my childhood. Excite Bike was also a very monumental game because it was the first game to feature battery backup. You could build your own tracks and save them, so when your friends came over on Saturday morning you could show them off. Excite Bike was all about gameplay. There was not a story to it at all. On the other hand, it didn't need one. I loved it anyway and didn't even notice the lack of storyline. Excite Bike is definitely a game worth checking out.

Directions - 
The gameplay was where it was at. Popping wheelies, jumping super high, and using turbo, it was awesome. You must be careful when using turbo though, watch your temp. gauge. If you don't let off turbo before it gets full, you will overheat. I liked having the option to race the clock by myself, or with other riders. When racing other riders you had to bob and weave through them so as not to touch them. Then, I found out that if you touch their front wheel with your back wheel, they will fall down. At that point it became a knockdown contest. Who can knock down the most guys in one race? I was pretty good at it.

Controls - 
A Button - Turbo Accelerate
B Button - Accelerate
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - N/A

Hints - 
Rapid Remount
- When you fall off your excite bike, you can tap A or B real fast and you'll get back on your bike faster.

Nintendo Vs. System - 
The Nintendo Vs. System is a coin-operated video game platform designed for two-player competitive play using the VS. UniSystem or VS. DualSystem, arcade system boards based on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Many of these stand-up or sit-down arcade machines had two screens and controls joined at an angle. These games were arcade ports of home video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, thus they could be sold cheaply to arcades in the late 1980s.

Hardware - 
The Vs. System was designed primarily as a kit to retrofit Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., Popeye, and Mario Bros. machines. Being as such, they require the same special monitor that these coin-ops used. These monitors use inverse voltage levels for their video signals as compared to most arcade monitors. Commercially available converters allowed one to use any standard open frame monitor with the game.

Almost all the games on the Vs. System ran on identical hardware, with the notable exception that four special PPUs (video chips) were also made, each containing a different palette (each of which appears to arrange the colors completely randomly). Most boards could be switched to a new game simply by swapping the program ROMs, though the appropriate PPU would also have to be used - if not, the game would appear with incorrect colors. Several of the later Vs. games employed further measures of protection by using special PPUs which swapped pairs of I/O registers and/or returned special data from normally unimplemented regions of memory - attempts to run these games in other Vs. systems would result in the game failing to even start.

There were some dedicated Vs. double cabinets produced which looked like two games butted together at an angle. A single motherboard powered both games on those models.

A steel sit down cabinet for the Dualsystem, nicknamed the "red tent" due to its upper portion's resemblance to a pup tent, allowed play for up to four players similtaneously. This cabinet used the same motherboard as the double cabinet referred to above.

Differences Between Vs. System and NES Versions - 
Sometimes the games were different from their NES versions. For example, Vs. Super Mario Bros. is considerably more difficult than Super Mario Bros; some of these levels are in the Japanese Disk System version of Super Mario Bros. 2. The graphics were also different from their NES counterparts; for example, Vs. Duck Hunt had more details and animation sequences than its console counterpart. Vs. Duck Hunt also contained a bonus stage which was notable for allowing players to shoot the dog who would normally obtain the ducks if the player shot them, and who would also laugh at the player, should the player miss the ducks.
