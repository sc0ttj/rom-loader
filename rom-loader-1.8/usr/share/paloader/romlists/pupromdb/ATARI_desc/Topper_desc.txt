Poor Topper, the little lovable turtle, who tries to liven up his universe by trying to paint his galactic tiles.  But, the mysterious dynamite, and the renegade rabbit, will stun him if they can.  It's up to you.  Can you help Topper while keeping hime from getting caught by the renegaged rabbits?  Can you save him from the mysterious dynamite before his tile is demolished?  Topper needs you.

To begin your adventure into Topper's enhanced reality, insert your ROMOX ECPC cartridge into your Atari home computer and turn on the power.  Select to play alone or with your friend and choose Topper's difficulty from A thru D.  Then simply press your joystick fire button or press the start key.  Get ready, here comes Topper.  Now it's up to you.  You must help Topper get from tile to tile to paint his home, but watch out, the tiles don't want to be painted and fly off with Topper on it, so you are safe.  But not safe from the mysterious dynamite or the rabits.  As you advance from group to group, the difficulty will change and Topper will have a real hard time trying to finish.  So keep your hands steady and your wits about you.

The levels of difficulty will change automatically from A through D, unless otherwise selected at the beginning of the game, every four tile groups.  Time is your worst enemy.  In each level, a fixed time limit makes Topper have to hurry more and more.  In level A, only the tiles try to escape from your Topper.  This is the easiest level.  In level B, your tiles continue to jump in and out.  But now you have to face the mysterious dynamite stick, which looks for you everywhere.  It's mission in life is to break your tiles with you on them.  In level C, the rabbits are here.  The renegade rabbits have landed and are out to get you.  But in this level, you only have to worry about one rabbit.  In level D, a whole bunch are out to stop you.  The tiles jump off at any moment.  The dynamite will try to blow the tile you are on, and the renegade rabbits try to catch your Topper.  If you can save him, and complete the tile group before the time runs out, you get to do it again, and again, and again....
