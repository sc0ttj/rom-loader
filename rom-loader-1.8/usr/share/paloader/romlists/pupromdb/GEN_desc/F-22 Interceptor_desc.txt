Take command of America's next generation Air Superiority fighter. Experience the real sensation of flight as you battle land, sea, and air targets in a vivid 3-D world! The F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter has it all. Fly over 100 unique missions in four combat zones - Iraq, Korea, Russia, and the USA. Or create your own battle with the Mission Generator. Engage 20 types of enemy targets including T-72 tanks, MiG-29 fighters, Hind helicopters, AA guns, SAM sites, and gunships. Arm your aircraft with a variety of high-tech weaponry and countermeasures. Use Sidewinders for dogfighting, or launch TOW anti-tank missiles at distant targets.

Gameplay:

This simulation puts you in the cockpit of the F-22. You can choose from 3 difficulty settings and fly strike missions in 4 theaters of war (United States, Iraq, Korea and Russia) with increasing difficulty. You can also challenge aces from each theater and design custom missions. To complete a mission, you usually have to destroy both ground and air targets, including several MiG types, helicopters and tanks in addition to ground structures. Use realistic weapons like Sidewinder and Maverick missiles.
