Based on the cyberpunk novel by William Gibson. In a grimy future, you play Case, a cyberspace cowboy who finds himself broke in Chiba City. Find yourself a laptop and the right software for it so you can hack into databases around the city to regain your access to cyberspace. Buy and upgrade brain implant chips to augment your computer skills, and sell your body parts to afford new technologies. When you get to cyberspace, you'll take on the nasty AIs that guard the most important databases. Within all this information is the bizarre secret of this world of inbred corporations.

Trivia: Intro music is a digitized version of Devo's "Some Things Never Change", composed by Mark Mothersbaugh and taken from their 1988 album "Total Devo". It was originally written for a Neuromancer film from Cabana Boys that never materialized. One of the primaries in Cabana Boys was Timothy Leary.

CHEATS:

When you first begin, sell all your body parts.  You can get along just fine without them for now, and it gives you enough to get a half way decent deck.  You will eventually need to buy them back before you start entering cyber-space, or you will be killed easily.
