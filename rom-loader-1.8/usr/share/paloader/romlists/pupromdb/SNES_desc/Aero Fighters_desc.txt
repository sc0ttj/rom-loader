There are 8 stages in this game. The beginning stages consists of randomly chosen areas from nations of unselected fighters (assuming those fighters have nations). If Rabio or Lepus is chosen, all 4 rival nation stages become playable. After completing all rival nation stages, there are 4 more stages.

In SNES version, the are 2 stage loops, and the order of rival nations is fixed. In 2nd loop, the game's difficulty increased, except in VERY HARD difficulty, where 2nd loop is easier.

Player and team-specific endings occur after completing 1st loop. After completing 2nd loop, ending consists of all pilot pairs giving a speech, with 2nd pilot in the last pair giving cheat code.

The SNES version adds hidden boss attack and time attack modes, Rabio and Lepus fighters (from Rabio Lepus, known outside of Japan as Rabbit Punch).

English version was released in limited quantities, and is one of the rarest cartridges for the Super NES.
