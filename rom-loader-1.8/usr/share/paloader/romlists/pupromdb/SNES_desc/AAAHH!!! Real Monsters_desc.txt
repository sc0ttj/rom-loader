I am the Gromble...

You may call me 'Your Headmaster Grombleness Sir.' Your performance so far at the Monster Academy has shown you to be a disgusting pile of worm-ridden filth - and I'm darn proud of you. BUT - you're going to have to prove yourself on your Midterm Exam if you want to call yourself a REAL MONSTER!

ICKIS! OBLINA! KRUMM! You three will work as a team on this exam. You will stay together at all times and will receive a single gruesome grade on your frightful performance.

For each portion of your exam, I will assign you a delightfully tasty bit of trash to find throughout the City and an unsuspecting human victim for you to scare. Your assignments will become increasingly terrifying, and to receive a passing grade you must eventually scare even the surprisingly fright-free MONSTER HUNTER!

Remember, you terror-trainees, collect only the finest trash and brush up on your most heart stopping poses to be on your scary best behavior. I'm expecting a lot from you and your monstrous abilities. Any questions? Nooo? Then get out there and petrify someone!
