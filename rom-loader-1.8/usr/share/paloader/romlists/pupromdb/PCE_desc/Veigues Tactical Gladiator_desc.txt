This is a really great game. Check her out. The graphics are better than a lot of what you'll see on supposedly superior systems like the SNES, and the music is pretty rockin' too. The control is spot on, other than the inaccurate jumping.

Here's a quick break down of what's gonna happen in every level: Begin level, battle off onslaught of cheap enemies (level 2 especially bothers me. Even though your chest cannon (hold I+II) is devastatingly weak, you have to use it against these guys, and they all die from it before getting a shot off. Boring!), go through the middle of the level, probably dodging some lasers and/or missiles, reach boss, blast him a new one, finish level and go to Veigues Command Center, where you can use your points gained (based off a formula of enemies killed and remaining shields) to upgrade your mech in a variety of ways. Go again.

On the one hand you could argue that this is a boring archetypal action game, but on the other hand, no game is quite like this, though the closest would probably be Atomic Robo Kid. If you're reading this review you're already interested. Indulge yourself, you won't regret it. 

HINTS:

- Continue code -
