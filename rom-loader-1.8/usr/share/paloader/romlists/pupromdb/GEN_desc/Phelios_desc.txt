You are Apollo, the god of the sun. The goddess of the moon, Artemis, has been kidnapped. Being the noble god, who cannot rule the world of light without his other half, you vow to rescue Artemis and make her captor pay dearly. Hopping on Pegasus, the winged steed, you leap to the sky. Suddenly a voice as clear as the moon on a starless night commands your thoughts. It is Artemis, calling to you from the distance. She has been turned to stone, but tells you of the mysterious sword, Phelios, the sword of light. Hoardes of enemies stand in your path, and evil abounds, but you must take your time and survive for is you don't, Artemis is doomed forever!
