Bubba and his sidekick Stix are an interesting pair, Bubba is a happy-go-lucky animal delivery guy for the local Zoo here on Earth . One day while going about his daily routine, Bubba is abducted by an alien that plans on delivering him along with several other aliens in their zoo. On the way back to his home planet, the alien spacecraft loses control and crashes, Bubba, the other aliens and Stix (a sentient twig like alien) are able to escape. Bubba and Stix become friends and start on their journey home, They're now on an alien planet, things are a little bit different than they are on Earth. Take control of Bubba as he wields Stix as various puzzle solving tools (including a weapon), as they try to find a way back home. You'll have to solve mind-boggling puzzles and fight all kinds of wacky aliens if you're planning to return to Earth, so you'll have to have fast reflexes and be able to think fast and sometimes sideways.

CHEATS:

On the beginning of level one, turn around and face the tree that follows you.  Get close to the tree and jump up and throw your stick over it.  Now when you land turn around and the stick will hit the tree a couple of times.  If the tree is still there repeat the previous steps, and the tree will eventually turn into a tiny tree.
Now go to the left and pick up all of the stuff.  Make sure you get the unicycle like thing with the head on it.  Now you should notice platforms have appeared throughout the level.  Get all the stuff that is on the platforms.  When you finish the level, you will be transported to a bonus level.
