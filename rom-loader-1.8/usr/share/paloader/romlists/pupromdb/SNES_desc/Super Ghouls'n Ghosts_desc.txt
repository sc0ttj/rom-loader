A KNIGHT'S QUEST

All hail, dauntless knight Arthur! Years ago you quelled the terrifying phantoms of the Ghoul Realm who hexed the earth, and rescued Princess Guinevere. Since that time you've journeyed far over the world seeking the powerful weapons of White Magic.

But now the kingdom is shrouded under an eerie spell. Sardius, the Emperor of Evil, has snatched Princess Guinevere away to the slimy crypts of the Phantom Zone. The Ghoul Realm has revived, and the Creatures of the Undead haunt the land.

Once again, you must survive the dangerous journey into the depths of the Ghoul Realm. You'll swat at horrid ectoplasms and ghouls whose touch is deadly. Vampires will swirl around your head. Voracious plants will snap at you, hungry for bones to gnaw. The earth will crack, the seas will swell, and the fiends of darkness will engulf you.

Your courage and skill will keep you moving through overwhelming terrors. And on the path, a mighty weapon - Magic - awaits!

Buckle on your sword, Arthur. It's time to begin your quest!

Super Ghouls and Ghosts is an action packed ride through an extremely hard game. Although the original Ghosts and Goblins on the NES platform was harder, this one was still pretty challenging. The graphics are very similar, only much better drawn and animated. The sounds were a little different, but all in all they sounded better and still had a Ghosts and Goblins feel to them. If you are a fan of the Ghosts and Goblins series, give Super Ghouls and Ghosts a try!

Directions:

Super Ghouls ans Ghosts was almost the same as the original NES game, it just had a lot of improvements. I especially liked the addition of the double jump. Although it isn't very realistic, it is very handy. Almost all the weapons are the same as the original, except for the ability to power them up. In Super Ghouls and Ghosts, you can get green and gold armor that will power your up your weapon. The green armor will imbue your weapon with a magic ability. The Gold will do the same, with the added effect of a magic ability for you. You will have to hold the attack button for a short time to charge this ability up, though. As if this were not enough, you also get a shield with your gold armor. This will block a small enemy projectile, letting you keep your armor. The enemies were the same except for the fact that they looked a lot batter graphically. The red gargoyles are still the hardest to beat, though. With the exception of the last one, the bosses are all different.
