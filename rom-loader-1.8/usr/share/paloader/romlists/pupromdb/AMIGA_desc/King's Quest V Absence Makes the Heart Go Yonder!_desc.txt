While it was a beautiful sunny day, King Graham decided to go out for a walk in the woods and hope that everything is normal when he got back. However, while he was gone, an evil wizard called Mordack uses a spell to warp his castle out of Daventry, along with the royal family. Soon after, Graham came back, only to realize that the castle is gone. After he wonders why, an owl called Cedric speaks to him about it and transports him to the land of Serenia, where his boss Crispin helps him get ready to face up to Mordack. Cedric is asked to go with him to make sure that Graham does not get in trouble.

CHEATS:

Easily charged wand:
To charge Crispin's wand easily, put Mordak's wand
on the left platform of the machine then throw the cheese in the
machine without putting Crispin's wand on the machine.  After
a few seconds the machine will stop and a message will appear,
telling you the machine did not do anything.  Put Crispin's wand
on the right platform of the machine, then walk down the stairs
into the next screen.  Then, go back.  Crispin's wand should be
charged and Mordak's wand weakened.
