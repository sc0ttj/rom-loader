Livingstone, I Presume? was one of the most famous games of Opera Soft. It is a video adventure technologically almost identical to Goody (also Opera's) but this game has a more complex map and an obligation to alternate among three weapons and a pole that you have from the beginning of the game.

The name of the game indicates a tour around each of the searches of David Livingstone that carry out the journalist Henry Morton Stanley in Africa in the XIX century. There the resemblance to reality ends, and turns into a platform game.
