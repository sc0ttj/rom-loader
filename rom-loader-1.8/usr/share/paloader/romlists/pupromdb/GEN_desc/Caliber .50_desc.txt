This part is simple, there is pretty much no story. All they tell you about the game is that you are a special forces member on a secret mission. Apparently this ''mission'' is so secret not even the player can know about it.

Here is what I figured the story was, but I could be wrong because I didn't have much to work with: You are a Special Forces member of the army and you are either trying to save somebody or recover some secret item. In your way there are hundreds of zombie like soldiers that shoot wildly mostly not in your direction.
