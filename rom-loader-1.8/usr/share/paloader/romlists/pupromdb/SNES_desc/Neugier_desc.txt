Neugier is wonderful little (if very short) game. It's one of those overhead action-RPG's (with a heavy emphasis on action) similar to Zelda (actually, I think it's closer to Lagoon, just a heck of a lot better, but then again Clu-Clu Land is a better game than Lagoon? ). The graphics aren't exactly anything to write home about, but that's okay because the fact that it is a completely fun game makes up for the graphics. The game follows the story of Duke, the banished son of the Count of Neugier who is returning home to investigate the sudden appearance of priates around his homeland. It's pretty good game, it should be worth your time
