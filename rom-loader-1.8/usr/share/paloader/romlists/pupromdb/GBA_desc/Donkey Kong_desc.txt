The big ape has returned in this update of the classic Nintendo arcade game. Although at first it appears to be just a port, the familiar levels from the arcade game are just a prelude to the real platform jumping adventure. Instead of rescuing Pauline at the end of the fourth level, Donkey Kong makes off with her once again!

There are 96 levels spread out over 12 worlds. These levels are much more complex than the originals, featuring scrolling backgrounds, numerous objects to collect, and enemies to avoid. Along the way, you will encounter several "boss" style battles with Donkey Kong, as well.

In the beginning video, Donkey Kong is at home channel-surfing. While flipping through channels, DK notices an ad about the new Mini Mario Toy. Right away, he decides to get his hands on as many as he can, so he steals them from Mario's Toy Factory. Now, Mario has to get them back.

Mario must find the key then rescue a Mini Mario in six levels of each world. In the seventh level, Mario must guide all the Mini Marios he collected through the letters T, O, and Y and into the toy box. The eighth and last level pits Mario against Donkey Kong. There are many enemies and obstacles to avoid, including Bob-ombs, Shy Guys, Boos, trash cans, fireballs, and Thwomps.
