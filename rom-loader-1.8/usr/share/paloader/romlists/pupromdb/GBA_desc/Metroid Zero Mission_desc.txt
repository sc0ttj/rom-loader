A hack for MZM which enables the debug fuction that allows you to toggle equipment on and off. Additionally, it will also allow you to toggle suits on and off(something the debug fuction didn't do) as well as a color fix for the fully powered suit for when you toggle the gravity suit off.

Pirates have stolen an unknown life-form, recently discovered on the planet SR388. The life-form, called Metroid, is in a state of suspended animation and, according to analysis, was the cause of the complete destruction of SR388. If it ever got loose, the alien could destroy countless other systems.

The pirates have taken the being to the planet Zebes and are fending off the Galactic Federation's attacks. It is up to the space bounty hunter Samus Aran to find her way into the planet's core, destroy the pirates, and take back the alien before the pirates complete their plans of world destruction.

Zero Mission takes Samus back to her first battle with Mother Brain, expanding on the original story line and action from the original Nintendo classic, Metroid, with updated visuals, new puzzles to solve, and cut scenes filling in the personal story of Samus.

The player can perform moves taken from the original game, along with additions taken from the last GBA mission, Metroid Fusion, including the power grab. This game can also be linked to Metroid Fusion to unlock special extras.
