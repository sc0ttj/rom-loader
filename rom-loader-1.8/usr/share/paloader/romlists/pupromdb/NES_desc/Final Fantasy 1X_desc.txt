Final Fantasy 1X changes the appearances of the characters in battle and makes some of the useless weapons, armor, and magic better. It also gives the black belt/master class his own set of skills.

Here are some of the changes, take from RPG Man's website -

- Vorpal Sword has been changed to the Sage Staff.

Armor - 
- Allowed the BB/MA to equip the ProCape.

Magic - 
- LV1 - FOG has been replaced by PURE and LOCK has been replaced by KICK

- LV2 - LAMP has been replaced by ABLT (Aura Bolt)

- LV3 - LOK2 has been replaced by FDAN (Fire Dance)
