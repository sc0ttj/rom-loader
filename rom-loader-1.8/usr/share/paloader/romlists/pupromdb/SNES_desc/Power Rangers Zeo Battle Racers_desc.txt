Power Rangers Zeo: Battle Racers was a SNES game released in September 1996 by Bandai. The game was based on the Zeo generation of Power Rangers. It featured Mode 7 graphics much like many of the SNES 'Kart' style games in the period. The game allowed for single play or 2 player split screen racing or battle mode. The game is often considered to be the only game based on the Zeo series, however another game, Power Rangers Zeo Versus The Machine Empire, was made for the PC.
