At the end of the century...

The reddish moon symbolizing the evil spirit world rises in the sky.

The followers of the evil spirit are resurrected with the rising of the moon.

Gallagher, king of the evil spirit's forces, bellows to all who listen:

"We will destroy the dream world first and then eliminate all who are not part of the evil spirit's reign!"

Yuko Ahso, goddess of the celestial Valis, awards the divine Valis sword to a young maiden from the dream world.

Lena receives the Valis sword to uphold her strength as a Valis warrior. She is the only one who possesses the power to defeat Gallagher.
