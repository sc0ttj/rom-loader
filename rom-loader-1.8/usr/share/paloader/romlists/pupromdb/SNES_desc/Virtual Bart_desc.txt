Bart volunteered to test out a virtual reality game machine. Now, he's trapped inside and must work his way through six crazy games to get out safely. Outwit or out-fight your foes, solve puzzles, and generally have a wild and crazy time, in Bart-asaurus land, Bart's baby years, Piggy Bart at the pork factory, tomato tossing, water slide, and motorcycle wars.
