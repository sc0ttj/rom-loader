TALL, PINK AND HANDSOME!

Everyone dreams of being a movie star, especially Pink Panther. He's just hit Hollywood, on his way to audition for an important role that will put his name in lights!

On his first day at MGM, Pink manages to wreck a scene starring the hot-tempered Inspector Clouseau. Not one to take injury lightly, Clouseau sets off on a hunt to foil Pink's chances at stardom!

The ever-resourceful panther races around the backlot, bombarded by rowdy cowboy boots, nutty squirrels and too-ripe turkey stuffing. He fights back with a bug sprayer full of "pink" and handy gadgets from his Bag of Tricks. He creates chaos on every movie set he dives into, from Pinkinhood to Pink Chill to Cat on a Hot Pink Roof But will his big break ever come?

Tips:

Invincibility
Hold down the L button on the second controller. For as long as you have the L button held, you will be invincible.

Level Skip
Pause the game with Start, then press Select. You'll automatically go to the next level.

Float in air
Plug in a second controller. Then press B. You will notice Pink flying.

Slow Motion
Not a useful game play trick, but it's fun to play around with. During gameplay, have a second controller plugged into the game console. Anytime during play, press and hold the R button on the second controller.  The game will almost look as if it was paused, but if you watch long enough you'll notice it's just in super slow motion.
