Overview:

Using the mouse to determine the direction and strength of your putts, you must navigate 9 tricky holes of crazy / mini golf. Try to putt into holes protected by bouncing hamburgers, windmills, etc. Courses have several twists; one is a mad scientists's lab, another is a pinball table. The final hole is especially bizarre, themed around energy.

You start with 3 strokes, but get the par for each hole added on, if you reach it in time - run out of strokes, and your game is over. You can earn bonus strokes by finding hidden bonuses and by completing courses quickly. Up to 4 players at a time can take part in this game, with anyone badly over par being eliminated as the game progresses.

Gameplay:

Zany Golf is a version of mini golf with some features that are impossible in real, physical mini golf. Zany Golf only consists of half a golf course, i.e. 9 holes, although there is a bonus hole. The holes are as follows:

   1. Windmill Hole (Par 2): The ball has to be shot into a windmill, or slide down the ramp below, to enter the second area.

   2. Hamburger Hole (Par 3): The hole is covered by a bouncing hamburger, reached by bouncing the ball off a ketchup bottle that squirts.

   3. Walls (Par 2): Several walls continuously rise from the ground and fall back down. Depending on the timing, these can deflect the ball at different distances.

   4. Pinball (Par 3): The level begins as a game of pinball, where the player can hit the ball with the flippers after shooting it.

   5. Fans (Par 3): Fans positioned along the level allow blowing the ball in a different direction.

   6. Magic Carpet (Par 2): A special "magic" surface covering most of the level allows direct mouse control over the ball.

   7. Castle (Par 3): The ball has to be shot up a hill, to enter into a castle or holes outside it, to enter the second area.

   8. Ant Hill (Par 3): The hole itself moves.

   9. Energy (Par 5): Consists of various contraptions all over the place, with buttons that activate deadly laser beams, energy blasters, teleporters and suction tubes. Widely regarded as the most difficult hole by far.

  10. ???: This bonus hole is accessed by either completing the entire course under par (26), or by putting into a secret hole on the Energy level with exact timing. This level consists of a Breakout-style scenario, followed by a challenge where the ball must be putted across a checkerboard square, where alternate squares when rolled over teleport the ball back to the start.
