Your code name is Bart. You are a captain of the Army Special Forces Unit. Your mission is to infiltrate GOON (Government of Offensive Network), a subversive organization whose aim is to break up the international economy and establish a worldwide smuggling ring. You will accomplish this by purposely being captured and imprisoned in their escape-proof armed camp. You'll have to fight your way out with your bare fists - but is you can break into the ammunition depot, you'll find grenades, knives, and M-16's to tip the odds in your favor. Your goal is to find and eliminate the leaders of GOON before they can carry out their diabolical scheme!
