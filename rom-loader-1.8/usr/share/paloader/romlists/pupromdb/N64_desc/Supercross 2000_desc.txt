Gameplay

Choose from among 24 real-world drivers and hit the track. When you want some competition, you will need to decide what type of action you want. If speed is your thing, play the Race mode and concentrate on finishing in first place. Should you prefer showmanship to speed, perform huge tricks and try to score as many points as possible with the judges in the Freestyle mode. In both modes you will have to contend with a true-to-life physics model, which makes the game a stop and start affair just like real supercross racing, and big tricks are harder to accomplish.

Supercross 2000 offers a range of race and freestyle modes. Quick Race is available for gamers who want to race without worrying about options. Similarly, a Quick Freestyle option is included. Additionally, there are Single Race, Freestyle, Practice and Season modes. Single Race lets one or two players race on 16 Supercross or five amateur tracks. The Freestyle mode is a timed competition for one or two players to see who can pull off the most stunts. Practice is for some solo action and includes an option for saving a ghost. Finally, there is a Season mode for one player to compete in the entire 16-track EA Sports Supercross Series.

Supercross fans will be delighted to know that Supercross 2000 contains all the important licenses. It's endorsed by the AMA and by Pace Motor Sports. It includes all 16 real stadium tracks from the EA Sports-sponsored series. It has 25 of the top Supercross and freestyle riders from the 1998 season and features play-by-play commentary from Art Eckman of ESPN and licensed music from Pulley and The Living End.
