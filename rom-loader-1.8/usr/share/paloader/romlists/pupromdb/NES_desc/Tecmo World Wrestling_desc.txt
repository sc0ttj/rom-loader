Between tournament matches, the player is given an option to train with his female trainer. He can chose to do button mashing exercises, either squats, situps, or push-ups (with a sumo wrestler on his back). Successfully completing training increases the character's fighting abilities. When all the competitors are defeated, the player must overcome the challenge of the final boss, Blue King The Manic Warrior, a nonplayable character, before winning the game.
