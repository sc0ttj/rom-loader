Big Apple crime is rotten to the core. Now, there's only one way to keep the peace. The way of the Ninja! Introducing the deadliest fighting skills the game world has ever seen! Ten awesome powers, including - Art of Invisibility. Disappear and become invulnerable to attack. Art of Fire Ring - incinerate enemies caught in your deadly ring of fire. Art of Teleportation - Freeze time to reposition yourself and surprise attackers.

The story takes place in New York City. Black Manta, a ninja, gets a call that kids are being kidnapped. Now, Black Ninja must go out to the streets and uncover the plans that involve the kids and maybe even drugs!

Directions - 
Classic side-scrolling tradition. You fight baddies.

In order to really beat the game, you must use your arts to succeed. Grab the red-shirt guys because they give up info to you. Cowards. You could also save kids that are in buildings and factories, which is good, because they give good info and power-ups! At each stage, you face a boss with a distinct fighting pattern.
