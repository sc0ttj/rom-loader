Race a single computer opponent for first place on a unique racetrack -- 100 feet in the air! You start in the fourth three-man division of a league, all racing each other twice, and must come top to progress. The action is viewed from within the car throughout the 3-lap races, with the distance between you always on screen.

Jump chasms, jumps, and drawbridges; take banks hard or slow; pass your opponent on the track or while catching mass air. Your car has the ability to burn a limited amount of turbo boost fuel as a way to accelerate faster and achieve higher speeds, but don't use it all up at once or you'll fall behind.  Don't damage your engine too much; severe dents will show up during your next race.

Whatever you do, don't fall off the track, as this will cost you time as you are placed back on.

CHEATS: 

If you get stuck in a hole or at the bottom of a jump, drive slowly up to the wall and accelerate with boost. This will minimise your damage.

Title: Stunt Car Racer TNT (The New Tracks)
Year: 2004 

This game was created by AmiGer/CARE (http://www.discreetfx.com/care/) by modifying the original game Stunt Car Racer. The TNT of the title stands for "The New Tracks". A track designer was written in Delphi and used to create 8 new tracks to race. The title screen and menu screen have been modified, as well as the colour palette.

The disk version has the track colours incorrect in the track preview window - they retain the reds from the original. The WHDLoad version fixes this problem.

2-player mode via null-modem connection.
