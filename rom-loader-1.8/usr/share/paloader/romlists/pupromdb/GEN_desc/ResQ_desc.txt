Good evening, Mr. Phelps. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to undertake a perilous rescue mission to the Adrianne star system. The planet has been laid waste by corporate raiders from the Wellmax company, who are even now going planetside to conduct a mopping-up operation for the few survivors hiding out in the city's tunnel system. Time is limited, so the decision to act must be made immediately. This tape will self-destruct in five seconds....

Only the boys from Liverpool could pull off a funny little arcade game that manages to combine the best of both the platform and shooter genres. The attempts at humorous stabs of various financial personages and events is stilted, but it's still a fun game to play. It's a shame that Sony chose not to distribute it, because it sure is a neat little piece of work.
