The Itchy and Scratchy Game is a 1995 video game that was released for multiple systems. It stars Itchy and Scratchy from FOX's The Simpsons and featured the classic gory violence from the TV show. In most versions, the main character is Itchy, who has to escape from Scratchy's multiple traps.

There are 7 levels to the game:

   1. Juracid Bath (Prehistoric world)

   2. The Medieval Dead (Medieval Castle)

   3. Mutilation on the Bounty (Pirate Ship)

   4. The Pusseidon Adventure (Under the Sea)

   5. The Magnificent Severed (The Old West)

   6. A Site For Sawed Eyes (Construction Site)

   7. Disassembly Line (Factory)

The game is played by running around the level, and killing various enemies. Both Itchy and Scratchy carry mallets as their standard weapons, although various other weapons, coordinating with the theme of the level can also be used. Every few moments, Scratchy will come onto the screen and then run away after attacking Itchy or Itchy has inflicted damage on Scratchy. Once Scratchy's health has been depleted, a boss battle will ensue.
