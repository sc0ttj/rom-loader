Well, they finally made up. Dr. Light and Dr. Wily are together again and working on a massive peace-keeping robot named Gamma. Oh, how wonderful that the bad guy is finally good; or is he? When the eight Robot Masters that were designed for good go haywire and steal the power crystals that power Gamma, Dr. Light calls Mega Man back on the scene. This time Mega Man has a new friend, a robotic dog named Rush. Also, Protoman, Dr. Light's first creation, came out of hiding, and nobody knows whose side he is on.

Mega Man 3 is almost identical to Mega Man 2 in terms of graphics, sound, and gameplay. That, however, doesn't make this game any less compelling. This game is every bit as classic as its two predecessors, with a few new additions. This game is fun and worth playing.

Gameplay - 
This is the first Mega Man game in the series to feature the ability to slide, remaining an important ability in later installments (with the exception of Mega Man 9). This is also the first game to feature Rush, Mega Man's canine companion, taking the place of the Item Number tools.

Hints - 

Super Jump and Invincibility; Press 'right' on controller 2 and Mega Man can jump much higher and walk across the bottom of pits. For invincibility, have Mega Man jump into a pit, then press 'right' on controller 2. Wait for the energy bar to go black and jump out of the pit. Mega Man will be invincible as long as he does not obtain any energy. Once invincible, the arm cannon no longer works but weapons obtained from bosses do.
