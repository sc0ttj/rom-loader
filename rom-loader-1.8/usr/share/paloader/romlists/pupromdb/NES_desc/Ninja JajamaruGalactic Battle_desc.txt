This game is obscenely like Super Mario Bros. 3. The graphics are similar, the onscreen display is similar. And of course, you fill enemies by jumping on them. Hell, you even jump into blocks for power-ups. The only thing they're missing is question marks on the blocks and a racoon tail.

That's not to say this is a bad game. It's actually quite fun. And there are differences! For one, the way dashing works is a lot more engaging than SMB. You can't just dash, otherwise you'll start somersaulting. You gotta dash, then let go before you jump! Yeah, you're right. It's more aggravating than the Mario way, but it still different!

Incidentally, I found out through playing this how poor I am at 2D platform games now. Once upon a time, I was really good! Now I'm used to all this new-fangled 3D stuff. So I died a lot. Your mileage may vary.

Translation Description - 
Well, this is a platformer that isn't text-laden. But a stupendous job was done of the text that was present, thanks to HTI. Not much more to comment on, so just go get the patch already and try it.
