Michael Andretti is on the world tour among some of the best tracks in the world. And you must take control of him. Drive your engine among the others and win the cup!

This game stinks. I had a hard time getting control of my car, it barely could turn. I never got up to speed, and I was driving an automatic. The person who designed this game is good on details of the course, but needs a class in computer graphics and the like.
