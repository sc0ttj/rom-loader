Oh my god, this game rules. Despite the fact that Hamel looks? shall we say? less than intimidating when he plays his violin at enemies, this game rules. It plays sorta like what would happen if Ys 3 and Milon's Secret Castle got drunk one night and? well, you get the picture. You play as this violinist guy who goes around playing music a lot. And you get this tag-along girl named Flute who you can chuck at enemies. But that's not all! If you collect costumes, she can morph into nifty other weird creature things that usually look rather demented, and she's invincible and has special powers. But she also tends to go off and do her own thing, and disappears RIGHT when you need her. So the costumes can be a bad thing too. But the game rules nonetheless. GO PLAY. NOW.
