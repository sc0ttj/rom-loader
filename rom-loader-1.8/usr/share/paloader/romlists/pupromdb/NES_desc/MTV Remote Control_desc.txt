Overview - 
This game is based on the show which aired on MTV in the late 1980s. It uses your usual quiz show format and asks you about the characters and events in popular TV show. You pick a category out of nine and a question is given. Buzz in first for your chance to answer the question. If you get the answer wrong, the question goes to the other players. The person with the highest score wins!

You'll expect some of the crazy things found in the show, but don't expect everything to be in the NES version. Also the theme song of the show is played the ENTIRE time, which is annoying after a while.
