This is an exceptional remake of all 52 levels of Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels with SMB Allstars(SMB3) style graphics.

It's quite refreshing to be able to play a classic with the up to date Super Mario World game engine and features. This includes the cape and Yoshi!

Everything is changed in this hack. There are new over worlds, some additional custom levels, changed tunes and more!

If you were a fan of SMB: TLL or SMW, it's recommended you give this hack a try.
