A severely ill man is on the operating table when a Daemon named Emily trapping you in your own subconscious. To escape you must find four orbs, which are trapped within a selection of esoteric mini-games set within the darkest Dali-influenced recesses of the mind.

Weird Dreams is a third-person-puzzle type game with very strange levels including feeding a wasp cotton candy, beating up hopping totem poles with fish from the sky, and an encounter with a baked chicken in a haunted house.

The game comes with a "short novel" that explains the plot in detail and serves as copy protection ( the "enter word on page 4, paragraph 5, line 6. word 8" type).
