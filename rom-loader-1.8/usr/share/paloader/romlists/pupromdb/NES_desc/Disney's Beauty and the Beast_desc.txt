A self-centered prince is transformed into a hideous beast by the magic of an enchantress. What's more, all his servants have been turned into household objects.

Before departing, the enchantress leaves a rose in the hands of his Prince, "This rose will bloom until your twenty-first birthday. You have until then to find the one you truly love and to earn that person's love in return. If you don't, you will be doomed to remain a beast forever."
