Fifth installment of New World Computing´s best-selling RPG-Series Might and Magic. This time, you control a party of 6 heroes to save the Darkside of Xeen. The game is the completion of the huge quest that begun in Clouds of Xeen and also brings to an end the story of the battle between the star travellers Corak and Sheltem, which started already in Might and Magic I.

The game uses nearly the same interface and graphics as Might and Magic III - Isles of Terra. Only small enhancements were made, e.g. that you don´t encounter any NPC randomly but have to select him via mouse click.

All over the gaming world, there are pyramids which work as teleporters as soon as part four of the series, Clouds of Xeen is installed. Might and Magic 4 and 5 together let you create the "World of Xeen" which includes multible cross-over quests in both parts of the game.
