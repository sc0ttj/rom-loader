Aztec Adventure is a traditional action/labyrinth game in which the player assumes the role of Nino, an explorer whose aim is to find the Aztec Paradise.

The labyrinth is full of Aztec mythology creatures and other ancient Mexican references.

Although it is a maze game, the controls are very simple and easy to manage.
