The GBA version of Activision Anthology is different from Activision Anthology: Remix Edition (Windows/Mac), Activision Anthology (PS2) and Activision Hits Remixed (PSP). It contains 56 games, more than the other versions, but it does not include the Imagic titles (Atlantis, Demon Attack, and Moonsweeper). A few of the extra games are homebrew.

You can also view the original cartridges (2D, not 3D like the other versions) and the manuals. This version also includes less music than the others. There are different game modes to play and you can earn original gamer patches.
