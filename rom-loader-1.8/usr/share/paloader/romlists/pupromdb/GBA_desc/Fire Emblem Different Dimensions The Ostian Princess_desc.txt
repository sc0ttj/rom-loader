Introduction and Info:

Project Name: Fire Emblem - The Ostian Princess

Based from: Fire Emblem - The Blazing Sword (FE7) [US Version]

Ok, guys. This is my first Fire Emblem Hack, and it tells a story similar to Lyn's. It features the daughter of Lilina(from Fire Emblem VI), Lilian. A young girl who looks a lot like her mother when she was young, like Lyn, she was born on the Lorca tribe but her father was not Hassar(of course!XD), Lilian's father was Monke, a former member of the Djute clan(who also appears as a boss in Fire Emblem VI). Monke joined the Lorca because that was the most peaceful tribe to live happily with his wife and daughter. There, he became the Lorca tribe's chief. The rest of the story you will find out.
