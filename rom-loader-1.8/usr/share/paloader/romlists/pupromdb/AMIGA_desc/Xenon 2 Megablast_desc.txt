Xenon 2: Megablast is vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed & health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship  scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.

A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also famous for its soundtrack by British electronica group Bomb The Bass.

TRIVIA: The theme tune is David Whittaker's rendition of 'Megablast (Hip Hop on Precinct 13)(7'' Mix)' by BOMB THE BASS, taken from the album "Into the Dragon" ? 1988 Rhythm King/BCM Records.
BOMB THE BASS's album version of "Megablast", in turn, is a remix of the soundtrack from the 1976 motion picture "Assault on Precinct 13", composed and directed by John Carpenter.
