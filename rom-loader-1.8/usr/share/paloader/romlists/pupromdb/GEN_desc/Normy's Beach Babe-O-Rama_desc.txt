The babes of the beach have been abducted by a mysterious spacecraft and it's up to Normy to rescue them. Travel through cartoon worlds with your Slip N' Time suntan lotion and use weapons ranging from rocks to chicken mallets as you battle strange villains. Your journey will take you through 29 wacky levels, back to Prehistoric times, Medieval lands, Transylvania, Heck, and even the far reaches of space. Six bosses will try to end your mission early, so press on and make the beaches beautiful once again!
