Reversi is based on an ancient game played with white and black pices on a chessboard.  The object is to "capture" your opponent's pieces by containing them between your own and win by ending the game with the most pieces.

With three levels of skill, the computer will play at the level you want - beginner, amateur or professional.

Sophisticated colour graphics and a winning strategy combine to promise you some unforgettable victories, and defeats.
