Final Fantasy 3 Eviltype is a patch of Final Fantasy 3 designed to completely rebalance the overall game, in such a way that it is as hard as reasonably possible without making it impossible for a theoretical newcomer to the game to still complete without unbelievable amounts of effort.

In less cheaply ripped-from-the-readme terms, Final Fantasy 3 Eviltype's goals are to both vastly increase the game's overall challenge, and to increase the usefulness of characters and equipment that were, in the author's opinion, somewhat flawed.

The degree of changes vary, for how notable they are; Does anyone remember how the Epee was totally forgettable? Probably not, they forgot it. On the other hand, how many people noticed how, well, mediocre Umaro was? Quite a few people. These are the things Eviltype attempts to rebalance into more useful forms.

It attempts to do this by improving the flawed issues, though; Only a scant handful of negative "nerfs" were added(Three spells, one removed steal, and one altered Rage.), and only when they were felt absolutely necessary.

But don't think this is going to be an easier trip because of this. Every single monster has been vastly improved on durability, damage, skillset, you name it, it's been improved?except when you least expect it, and often how you least expect it!

Hopefully, you'll enjoy it. Regardless, the goal I set out for when I made it was completed when I finished it; I enjoyed it. ^_^

"This is a modification of the game Final Fantasy 3 US Version 1.0. This makes the game MUCH harder and adds more flavor than the original."

This is a difficult hack of Final Fantasy III US. In addition to being challenging there are new monsters, some dialogue changes, and a whole new way of learning magic. Overall, it's a good hack if you mastered the original game.

This is the "Core Hack" meaning it's not the whole game. What it is though is a large series of modifications I made to the game with help from other contributors which I'll list in the credits below.

This hack contains:

- New Title Screen

- New Characters

- New Spells

- New Lores (Replaced to "Weave")

- New Dialog/Menu Font

- New Item Icons

- New Items

- New Content

- Hold "B" to run.

- Vicks/Wedge start with all Magitech skills.

- "Annihilated" changed to Owned.

- Psycho Cyan fix.

- "Summon" ability now works.

- "Sword Tech" is now sped up.

- Names are now lower case.

You may be wondering what "Weave" is, well when you combine two elements, it makes a new spell. This is what I call a "Spell Weave", original or not I liked the idea and implemented it.

This hack was mainly made for rom hackers who hack bosses or for any other use which pertains to rom hacking.

The Japanese version of Final Fantasy III. Or the Japanese version of Final Fantasy VI, if you played the Playstation version. Between this and FF3US, the only big difference is the title screen. Anything else is just nitpicking in the translation itself. Though I admit, Pearl instead of Holy was kind of weird. But, whaddaya going to do.

When this game first came out over here, the only chance I got to play it was on my friend's SNES when I was housesitting for him and his family while they were on vacation. There weren't any open save slots, though, and I didn't want to risk deleting one that had important stuff on it, so every day I played through the game as far as I could without saving. The farthest I got was the Lete River. Not too far, but not bad for an afternoon's work. I was absolutely enthralled by the game's story, and characters, and graphical excellence. Once SNES9x was released for the first time, I played through it again on my roommate's computer (with sound even) and got to the Floating Continent. Again, great stuff.

Once I bought Final Fantasy Anthology and was set and determined to finish the game, I realized something. While the story is decent, and the characters all have slightly more personality than most RPG characters (with notable exceptions), after the Floating Continent the game does a complete 180 on play style. Instead of following the story, you're now given full control to go wherever you want in your shiny new (old) airship, and the developers expect the gameplay to carry the game until the final dungeon. And it doesn't.

Eventually you discover Espers (or Phantom Beasts, or whatever), which work a lot like your equipment in Final Fantasy IX: in battles you get points that go to your Esper. Once your Esper reaches 100% in a particular area, your character gets a certain magic spell. The problem is, (almost) any character can equip any Esper. What the hell is the badass royal martial artist doing casting Ultima? And why can he do it just as easily as the half-esper magic user? Eventually, all that distinguishes the characters from each other is their special moves. And honestly, why would you ever not have Edgar and Sabin in your party? Granted, the whole cookie-cutter aspect isn't as bad as FFVII, but unlike FFVII, running around in dungeons, fighting monsters and solving simple puzzles, just isn't any fun. It's enjoyable at first, but by the end all the game's faults just end up being intolerable. Playing through it becomes a chore, and eventually you'll say to hell with getting the cool Espers and items, let's just fight the stupid boss already.

So in short, play until you get to the Floating Continent. You'll enjoy it more. Granted, the story and graphics are great, and the soundtrack is easily in the all-time 10 best ever, but it's hard to say whether or not having to suffer through the actual game is worth it.

Again, I did beat the game, so hopefully JCE3000GT approves of my review this time.

Translation Description:

This patch is interesting for a few reasons. For one, it's a compelete, more faithful (at least according to Sky Render) translation of Final Fantasy 6. Whether or not this is a good thing and was worthwhile will be left to the discretion of the viewer. The hacking work is superb, though, that can't be denied.

Another interesting thing about it is that ChrisRPG and Sky Render have attempted to fix a number of bugs that had passed by Square's testers and lodged themselves in the original game. These fixes are all completely optional, and can be activated by using the various patches here in the ZIP. Be sure and apply them after you apply the translation patch. Check out the readme for more details.

Tips:

Double Mp with Runic!!
Equip Celes with a Cursed Shield. If she absorbs (with runic)a spell the shield }Save anywhere in Kefka's Tower
First start by getting one of your groups onto a save point. Now cycle through the groups until you arrive back at the one on the save point. Switch groups one more time and go to the party screen and the 'Save' command should be useable (and you can even use Tents!). Even after walking around and getting into a battle, the Save command should still be available.  

Easy Level Ups
Note: you must have a turbo controller to do this trick When you make it to the Lete River, set your window commands to 'Short' and switch Banon's 'Health' and 'Attack' then switch the commands back to 'Window' so you can have Banon's Health as the default command.  When you get to a point where you have a choice of going 'Straight' or Left set your controller to turbo and tape down the A button. Leave your game on overnight and you will likely be around level 50-60.

Save a Character (spoilers)
As the world is collapsing on the Floating Continent, and you have six minutes to get off, make your way to the very end where you can jump down to the airship. Instead of jumping, wait and do not move. When there is five seconds left on the clock Shadow will appear and jump down to the airship with you instead of dying.

Save Cid
When you're supposed to catch some fish for Cid, be sure to catch the fast ones that moves around in the water and give those to Cid so he can live. If you catch the slow ones and feed them to Cid, he'll die because the slow ones are the sick fish and the fast ones are the healthy ones.

No information online about this hack.  ~Rx
This new Final Fantasy VI hack makes quite a few changes to gameplay whilst leaving the original story intact.

This hack has increased enemy stats, given the AI new (and smarter moves) while altering equipment and Espers. Equipment has been made more unique to each character, and certain characters have new skillsets- for example, Mog has Jump instead of Attack.

Equipment has been rebalanced, meaning you won't see any more Genji Glove/Offering combos. You'll have to form strategies to deal with each boss!

Additionally, most glitch fix patches have already been applied to the game.

This hack is my first ever, and I appreciate all comments. My e-mail is in the Readme file. Have fun!

http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/617/
The hack replaces characters, enemies, bosses, items, commands, spells. I also changed much of the dialogue so that the story line follows the old "Warriors of Light" scenarios.

Fixed since last version posted on romhacking.net:

- difficulty increased
- "new" character
- All palettes fixes
- battle glitches fixed (especially text)
- new monsters
- new monster attacks/ behaviors
- storyline fixes (for consistency)
