The hack replaces characters, enemies, bosses, items, commands, spells. I also changed much of the dialogue so that the story line follows the old "Warriors of Light" scenarios.

Fixed since last version posted on romhacking.net:

- difficulty increased
- "new" character
- All palettes fixes
- battle glitches fixed (especially text)
- new monsters
- new monster attacks/ behaviors
- storyline fixes (for consistency)
