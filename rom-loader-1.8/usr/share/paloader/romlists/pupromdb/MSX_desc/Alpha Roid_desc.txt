"SOS! Centacom! Our central computer has broken down. We will be delivered to the Gentiles. Unless Space Marshall Alpharoid restores law and order."

Alpharoid is a combination of horizontal scrolling shooter and a battle bots fighting game. You control Space Marshall Alpharoid and must restore law and order by blasting your way through space and fight head-to-head combat battles with several androids.

While blasting your way around in space you'll find pit holes on several locations and entering a pit brings you to an android which must be defeated.
