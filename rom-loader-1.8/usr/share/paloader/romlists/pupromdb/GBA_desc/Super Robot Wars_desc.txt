The game that started it all! Super Robot Wars is a mecha crossover strategy/RPG. You get units from various Mazinger, Getter Robo, and Gundam TV shows all joining together to battle the evil Girgilgun, a world-destroying monster. There's really not much more to it than that, although interestingly SRW1 is one of the few SRW titles to support multiplayer.

Translation Description:

This is the game that started it all. As such, well, it's not that great. But it?s a relatively easy hack, and it's interesting to see how far the series has since come. The plot is relatively lean in comparison - Girgilgun has attacked the Super Robot homeworld, and is using an electromagnetic ray to mind-control most of the Super Robots into doing his bidding! But a few have managed to shake the shackles of Girgilgun?s control, and are fighting back. That?s it, really.

To quell any rumors before they begin, this is a continuation of strag0's old v0.7 patch you can find floating around (with his blessing.) It was really more like .3, but yeah? I?ve fixed all of the attack names and robot names. They all fit in the ROM, full length, with no clipping? of course, some had to be shorted for screen space consideration, but them?s the breaks. I fit in what I can!
