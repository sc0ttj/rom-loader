The morning sun heats the jagged peaks as you follow the forgotten road down to the valley floor. The bleached ruins of great columned temples and towering citadels rise from the grassy plain like the bones of some colossal beast. Surely this was the ancient city of Erinoch, destroyed by dragon's fire over 1000 years ago. Mordamir spoke often of this city...

Mordamir! Your teacher in the arts of wizardry. Surely he visited the fabled Labyrinth of Eternity buried beneath the ruins of Erinoch! Perhaps this is where you will once again come face to face with your long lost master...

Overview - 
The Immortal is legendary for its profoundly-steep learning curve and practically-impossible difficulty. Indeed, some sections of the game seemingly required the player to die in order to progress.

There are also a number of 'one false move' style death traps, and it is even possible to die in the very first room of the game. It is also remembered for the copious amounts of violence it contains; there are over 30 death animations for the player character, involving a variety of traps and monsters.
