Although it doesn't offer anything spectacular in the way of graphics or sounds (the music is downright silly for a war game), P.T.O. (Pacific Theater of Operations) is a satisfyingly realistic simulation that lets players act as Supreme Commander in WWII of either the Japanese or Allied Forces. The turn-based action, which relies heavily on tactical maneuvering and strategic command decisions, involves planning attacks, launching air strikes, managing a budget, implementing a draft, and much, much more. The game boasts a sophisticated mapping system for plotting your course, 250 ships based on those that fought during the war, and nine historical scenarios, including the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway.
