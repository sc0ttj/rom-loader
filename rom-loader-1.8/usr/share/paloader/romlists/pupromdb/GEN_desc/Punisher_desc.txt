Stepping out of the pages of your favorite Marvel comics come The Punisher and Nick Fury, ready and willing to mete out some lessons from the school of hard knocks as they battle the bad guys on their way to a showdown with the nefarious crime overlord Kingpin.

Gameplay:

Choose either hero and play solo or with a friend. You have an arsenal of attacks at your disposal such as kicks, super kicks, jumps, rolls and sweeps. You can combine your attacks into more lethal ones or pick up such weapons as pistols, grenades, knives, throwing stars and others for even more damage-causing power. Grab random containers and smash them to get power-ups or weapons.

You only have a certain amount of health and can replenish what the bad guys take away by picking up such food items as hot dogs, pizzas, chicken and pudding. Some foods also give you bonus points, as do little treasures like coins, emeralds and rubies. Once your health runs out your game is over unless you drop more coins in the slot to continue on your quest for justice.

You move through various environments such as trains, buildings, prisons and city streets while battling the bad guys. All of your nemeses have special talents which they will use against you; try to remember what they are for future successes. There are six stages in the game with a bonus one after the third. Each has an end-of-level boss; the Kingpin waits for you at the end of the sixth stage.

Trivia:

The Punisher is a Vietnam War veteran named Frank Castle who became a vigilante after his family was killed by the mob. He first appeared in the comic book Amazing Spider-Man #129 in 1973.
