This is the world's first Astyanax level hack, This hack was being worked on and off for almost 2 years. You'll notice that the levels and text has been changed, and there's also some minor graphics changes.

People who'll remember this game can tell you that the gameplay is similar to Legendary Axe on the TG-16. And people'll also enjoyed the original game will get get their Astyanax fix. :p

Well, I hope you all enjoy playing this hack as much as I had fun making it. :)
