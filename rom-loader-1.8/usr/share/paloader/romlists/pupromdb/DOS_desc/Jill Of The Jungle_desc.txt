Jill of the Jungle is a classic shareware game, which signalled the imminent emergence of famous software developer and publisher Epic Megagames, one of this decade's leading software developers with titles such as Unreal.

The game itself is a simple platform game where you take the role of Jill of the Jungle: an amazon woman who takes the untypical role of monster-slaying, leather-wearing feminist warrior. With this in mind, you will face 16 levels of puzzle-solving and monster-slaying with the use of several types of weapons and all sorts of enhancements.

This is the first in a series of three games.
