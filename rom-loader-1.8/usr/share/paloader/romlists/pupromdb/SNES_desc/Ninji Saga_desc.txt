A short yet sweet adventure from the perspective of one of those jumpy little guys from SMB2. Though its only 8 levels long, its still very fun, and the ASM and graphics are superb, similar in style to that of Super Mario Odyssey. It can be a challenge in areas, but is moderately easy as a whole. Worth checking out.
