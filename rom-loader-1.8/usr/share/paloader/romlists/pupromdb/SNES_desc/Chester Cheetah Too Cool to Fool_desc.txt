Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool was a 1992 video game that starred Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah and only released in North America. The instruction manual contains a popular Engrish that is recognized by many gamers, "As is Chester Cheetah way, is one-person play." The Engrish spawned due to bad translations and an intent to rhyme in a verse form similar to Dr. Seuss' anapestic tetrameter.
