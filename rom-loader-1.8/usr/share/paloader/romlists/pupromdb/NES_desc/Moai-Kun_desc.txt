This is a very strange game. It's a platform puzzler, and it reminds me somewhat of Lolo for some reason. Anyway, you're this dinosaur-looking thing and you have to collect these things and go through a door. I realise this descrtiption is vague, but it's a puzzle game for crying out loud.

Anyway, as easy as collecting things and going through doors may sound, it ain't! There's all sorts of critters out to get you, and rocks to push around and bricks to head-butt. It's good 'ol fun puzzle-solving. Check it out.

Translation Description - 
Yet another of the famed "title screen translations" where the only Japanese text in the entire game can be found in the title screen. So, there you go, here's your game in English. Whee.
