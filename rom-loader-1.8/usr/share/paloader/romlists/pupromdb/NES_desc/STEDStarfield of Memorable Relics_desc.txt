This is one of those games that really could have benefitted from an instruction manual. People say that this is a Phantasy Star clone, but I wouldn't know, since I've never played them. Yeah yeah, I know, PS rules, shut up. I assume the game is in the future, and it starts out with you crash landing (maybe?) on a planet from which you got a distress signal. It's all very confusing, since you have no clue what anyone's talking about. The items and weapons are equally confusing. The menus are awkward, the status screens are incomprehensible, and the battles are pretty fun, but very sloooow. However, despite everything, it manages to go beyond it all and end up being a pretty fun game. Since you don't know what's going on, it IS quite frustrating. I admit I didn't give it much of a chance, since I can't handle much frustration at six in the morning.

Translation Description - 
necrosaro just came out of the blue one day with this completely translated game. He'll admit not even he, nor anyone he knows, can beat the game, but everything should be translated anyways.
