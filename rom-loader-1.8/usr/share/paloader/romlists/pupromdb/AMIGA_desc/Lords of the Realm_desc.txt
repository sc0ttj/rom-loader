The English throne lies empty in 1268 A.D.  You and 5 lords are locked in a struggle for the crown.  Reap the benefits of successful feudal governing, castle-building, castle-sieging, and land battle to conquer your rivals and claim the kingdom.

You must keep your serfs fed and happy.  Then assign them to farming, herding, building, military and other tasks.  Design your own castles or build them using actual historical blueprints.  Then lay siege to your neighbors' castles and fight out land battles in tactical detail.

CHEATS:

Extra stone and wood:
Begin game play and build a castle using 3 tons of
wood and 5 tons of stone. After the castle is completed, extend
the boundaries with a few extra walls, a gatehouse, and a moat.
Select "End Design" and immediately demolish the castle
before it is built to access 65,000 tons of stone and wood. 

Extra gold:
Wait for a merchant to appear, then sell 100 stone
four times, and buy 2,000 of each weapon. The gold total will
increase instead of decreasing. Note: Do not purchase more than
2,500 of each weapon or money will be lost.
