Barbie Super Model has three modes of play.

The first is Free Play, a mode in which you can dress Barbie up in one of several outfits and then do her makeup in various ways.  After she is ready, you get to do a quick model routine in which you can not possibly mess any thing up.  This mode seems rather pointless, unless you are into the whole design your own Barbie fad.  This mode is the only mode limited to one player.

The second mode of play is Junior Super Model.  This mode offers every aspect of the game as the third mode, but at a greatly reduced difficulty level. Essentially, everything moves much slower and some hazards do not exist in this mode.  Again, I see no point in doing this mode as the game is not particularly challenging if you are over the age of seven.

The final mode is Super Model.  This is the only difficulty I recommend anyone play the game on.  Hazards move fast enough where you may actually have to move out of instinct, rather than a deliberated evasion plan.
