Panic in River City!

"To the citizens of River City - I hold your high school captive! With my gangs of students and vicious bosses roaming the streets, nobody can stop me now. Meet my demands - or else!"

Slick, the meanest, most powerful gang lord in River City, has issued this ultimatum - and the entire town is powerless in a grip of fear!

Fortunately, Alex and Ryan weren't in school the day Slick took it over. But now, their fellow students are prisoners - including Ryan's girlfriend! It's up to our two young heroes to battle their way past several dangerous city gangs, then defeat the gang lord to free the students of River City High and restore peace to the panic-stricken populace!

--From the NES River City Ransom instruction manual.

Overview - 
River City Ransom is a pretty fun game. I liked the mix between fighter and adventure. You can go into stores and talk to people to buy food, and books that will teach your charecter new techniques. The graphics on River City Ransom were pretty good too. The people were a little unproportional, but they still looked good. There are also a lot of weapons to pick up and fight with. You can also throw the weapon at the attacker. River City Ransom is a very fun game and I think everyone should try it at least once. 

Directions - 
Save River City and Ryan's girlfriend from Slick.

Hints - 
Faster Attack
If you want to be able to kick, punch, or use a weapon faster, then buy books at the bookstore. Use them, and you will acquire the technique. You will need to buy a book for every technique.
