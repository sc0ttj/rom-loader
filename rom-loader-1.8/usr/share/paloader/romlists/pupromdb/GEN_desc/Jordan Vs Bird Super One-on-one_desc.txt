Can Jordan Shoot Down Bird? Super one-on-one intense action: Larry's dead-eye outside game against Michael's explosiveness! Jordan's Slam Dunk Contest: Fly high, score higher. Five judges rule the court when Michael takes off! Bird's 3-Point Shootout: Gobble up those 3-pointers like Bird and you'll be the ultimate money ball player!

Gameplay:

While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition.

While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping abilities?

Hints:

- Extra Time -
When the clock gets to 00:00 in the timed ''One-on-One'' mode, pause the game. Next, press A in order to call a timeout. The game will keep going on with 36 minutes left on the clock.
