Oh no! The evil Yeti is trying to freeze the world and turn it into a frozen nightmare. Grab your nuts and leap into action to stop the abominable snowman, Mr. Blizzard. Don't let this little red squirrel fool you, he is a lean, mean, nut flinging machine.

Mr. Nutz is a fun platform game that takes a whole new meaning to Bright-eyed and Bushy-tailed. With awesome graphics that even show you the buzzing wings of the bees and the juice that flies out of the berries. The music of this game is zany and funny, which keeps up the mood of the game. All in all, this game is fun and worth playing.

Directions:

Mr. Nutz is an action platform game that takes you through six areas of zany fun. Jump on your enemies or use your tail to whip them. Also along you way you will find acorns that you can hurl at your enemies. Collect coins to raise your score and get more lives. Be sure to keep an eye on your health which is in the upper left hand corner of the screen, along with your number of lives and the number of acorns you have. Run through six levels to get to Mr. Blizzard and stop him from freezing the world. At the end of each level is one of Mr. Blizzard's henchmen, such as Mr. Spider, the Vulture Witch, the Octopus, the Giant and the Clown. So get crackin' and stop the evil Yeti from carrying out his plan. Good Luck.
