Gameplay

Tommy Pickles' father has been sent to Europe in order to fix a broken robot at EuroReptar Land and has decided to bring his family and friends with him. The player controls various characters through 16 levels as well as hidden bonus levels in both single and multi-player games. The object of the game is to collect enough gold Reptar tickets to buy the Reptar Helmet that controls a Giant Robot Reptar. There are also various mini-games.

The PC version does not include collecting Reptar tickets, and it seems to be centered more around Chuckie and his concern about his father, who wants to re-marry.

A Sega Dreamcast version of the game was planned to be made, but it later got canceled.
