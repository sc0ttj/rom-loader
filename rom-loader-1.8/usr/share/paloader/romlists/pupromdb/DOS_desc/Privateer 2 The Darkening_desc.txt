Trivia:

A very strong rumour (read: unproved but very strongly backed) says that in a a post Wing Commander 3 press release Origin had prepared a 3 space-sim lineup on the wake of WC3. Wing Commander 4, Privateer 2, And a little british game already in development called "The Darkening". Subsequently thanks to WC4's humongous budget and the fact that The Darkening already had a working rendering engine and was in Beta. Privateer 2 got scrapped, and the Darkening became what we know now as Privateer 2.

Furthermore, it seems that original promotional material for Privateer 2: The Darkening referred to the game simply as "The Darkening", offering further indications that Erin Roberts' game was christened a sequel to Privateer after it was completed.
