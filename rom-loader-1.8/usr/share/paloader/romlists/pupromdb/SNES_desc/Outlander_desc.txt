Outlander is an action driving video game with a post-apocalyptic theme. It was rumoured that it was to be titled Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, following suit from Mindscape's previous Nintendo NES Mad Max title based on the same movie, however Warner Brothers did not give Mindscape the required rights. Mindscape edited the graphics and changed the name from Mad Max II into Outlander. Along with the similarities to the Mad Max universe including their own version of the V8 Interceptor, there is a tribute on the life bar meter on the bottom of the screen. It says "MAX" but it was placed there to serve more as a homage as opposed to letting the player know they had maximum health. The game has achieved Cult status among Mad Max fans and Retro Gamer fans alike. The game was developed and published by Mindscape in 1992 for the Sega Genesis and in 1993 for the Super Nintendo.
