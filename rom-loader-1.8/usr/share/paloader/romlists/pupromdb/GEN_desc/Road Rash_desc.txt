No Speed Limit? No Rules? No Problem! Blow 14 opponents off the backroads of California in the most illegal, unofficial and dangerous race there is. Kick and punch your opponents outta the way at 150 mph. Snatch a club - if you wanna do some real damage. Avoid cows, road blocks, oil spills and oncoming traffic! Finish the race to take home cash or look for a police escort to your favorite jail. The roads get tougher and your opponents get meaner with each new level - so get used to the abuse. Eight bikes are up for grabs - if you have the cash!

Directions:

Race and fight your way to the top. Just don't forget to spend your cash on new bikes so you can stay ahead of the competition. Oh yea, watch out for the cops too!

Gameplay:

Road Rash boasted a smoothly-rendered vertical element, which was uncommon on consoles at the time. In most traditional older racing games, the player's vehicle remained on the same horizontal plane, negotiating turns essentially by going right or left (see Pole Position). In Road Rash, players had to contend with grade changes, and the physics, though rudimentary compared to today's games, reflected the act of going up or down a hill, as well as turning while climbing, etc. This resulted in the ability to launch one's motorcycle great distances, resulting in often amusing crash animations. Road Rash also introduced an interactive race environment, with street signs, trees and poles, as well as animals (livestock for example) which could interact with the player's vehicle. This was also one of the earlier games to feature active traffic, which created a more immersive and realistic environment, as the player had to contend with slow moving station wagons and the like while racing against other bikers. Aside from high speed, big-air, and spectacular crashes, what separated Road Rash from other racing games was its combat element. The player could fight other bikers with a variety of hand weapons. The player would initially start off with just his hands and feet, but if the gamer timed a punch right, they could grab a weapon from another rider. The weapons themselves ranged from clubs, crowbars, nunchakus, cattle prods and even police batons. Fights between riders to knock each other off the bike would often go on at high speeds through traffic, pedestrians and roadside obstacles, with the victor gaining place and the loser sustaining bike damage and losing time.

The motorcycle police officers have dual antagonistic roles. They fight the player as another opponent, and they also serve as game play enforcers by policing the back of the pack and culling players who fall too far behind or choose to explore the world rather than race in it. The stakes are higher for losing a fight with a police officer than for losing to another player: Losing a fight with an officer would cause the player to be fined and "busted" and the race would end. Players could also be "busted" by getting caught by an officer while off one's motorcycle.

Players could choose between three categories of motorcycles in each price level: Sport/GT bikes, Race replicas and Cruisers. The Sport/GT bikes were designed after European Grand Touring bikes-they handled well, were of moderate weight and had moderate power. Race Replicas were the Japanese style super bikes-very quick, very light. The cruisers are American style-a little heavy, don't turn too well, but lots of straight line power. The 32-bit versions introduced a fourth type called a Rat bike which was a stripped down Frankenstein-style bike which was nimble and had a lot of durability. Select bikes at the higher levels had N2O boosts.

In addition, later editions of Road Rash became some of the first video games to include licensed music tracks from major recording artists in gameplay. Soundgarden was one such artist included. In addition, a billboard in many of the maps has an EA logo.
