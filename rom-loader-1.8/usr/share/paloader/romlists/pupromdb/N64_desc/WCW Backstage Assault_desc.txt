Overview

Backstage Assault is vastly different from other games of its genre. Any wrestling game prior to it that featured backstage areas (such as the SmackDown! series or its predecessor, WCW Mayhem) treated them as auxiliary fighting locations. Backstage Assault took the concept further by removing the ring entirely and having all action take place backstage.

Hardcore Challenge

Hardcore Challenge is Backstage Assault's primary gameplay mode. It consists of winning matches against random opponents until challenged by the champion. Throughout the game, players can unlock wrestlers, arenas, and moves for use in Create-a-Superstar. The player cannot defend the championship after earning it.

Info

It was the final World Championship Wrestling game to be released before the company was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation. The game features commentary by Tony Schiavone and Bobby "The Brain" Heenan. To date, the game has sold only 200,000 copies.
