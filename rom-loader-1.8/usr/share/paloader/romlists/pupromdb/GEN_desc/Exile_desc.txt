The story is pretty interesting. You are Sadler. The king of a tribe of desert people that are fighting against the Luciel army. Though that is what you are trying to do at the beginning, the story takes some turns and you end up doing something totally different than what you intended to do.

This game is like both an Action game and an RPG. This game is not too long ( It probably didn't even take me 10 hours to finish.) and it is pretty straight forward so you wont need to worry about doing puzzles. It doesn't get any more complicated than finding a person. When you're in towns you move around and talk to people like you would in Final Fantasy. When you go into dungeons it is like it would be in a side scrolling action game. You will gain Experience points and Gold by killing enemies. There is an easy way to get yourself leveled up really fast. There are some spots that if you stand still you kill the enemy and it will keep re-appearing. You have to have a controller with an Auto Turbo button to do it. Just turn it on Auto Turbo and you'll just keep attacking while the enemy keeps re-appearing for you to kill. But if you do, this the game will have almost no challenge at all because you'll be gaining levels while you're in the bathroom taking leak.
