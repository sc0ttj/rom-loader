Virtual Pool 64 is a 3D, first-person sports simulation video game that was developed by Celeris and released for the Nintendo 64 by Crave Entertainment on December 17, 1998, solely in North America.[1] The game features computer simulations of 11 forms of pool (pocket billiards). It is part of the "Virtual Pool" game franchise, which also includes the PC games Virtual Pool, Virtual Pool 2, Virtual Pool Hall and Virtual Pool 3. The game has been simultaneously lauded as "a top-notch simulation" and criticized as dull, lacking both player incentive and engaging characters.
