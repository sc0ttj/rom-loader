I remember enjoying the Kart Fighter rom on the net since I first saw it many years prior. The game itself is not too great, if you've played any of the Street Fighter clones on NES then you've played this game.

Something enjoyable about Kart Fighter is that the characters are from Super Mario Bros. If you've played Super Smash Bros. or Super Smash Bros. Melee, you would probably agree with me that Kart Fighter is a close cousin.

I always get a good chuckle our of the graphics. Parts of the game look "ripped" from Nintendo's Super Mario Kart game; other backgrounds look like they were swiped from Little Nemo - Dream Master. The characters themselves...absolutly weird. When Luigi fights, he looks like he is on drugs. Princess Peach is dressed in a short skirt, I guess she's showing off her sexy legs? Some of the other characters look quite humerous as well.

Okay, here's a weird one. Kart Fighter is an unlicensed "pirate original" fighting game for the Famicom which features characters from Super Mario Kart beating the holy hell out of each other, Street Fighter style. Sound like Super Smash Bros? It shouldn't. This game predates Nintendo's own take on the genre by several years, and in fact could be cited as a source of inspiration for the creation of Smash Bros. Well, okay, maybe not. But still.

Anyway, Kart Fighter is...well, it's actually really good, surprisingly. Some would go as far to say that it's the best one-on-one fighting game on the NES, though its only serious competition is Joy Mech Fight, TMNT Tournament Fighters, and all that unplayable pirated crap like those "ports" of The King of Fighters, Mortal Kombat, and the dreaded Cony versions of Street Fighter.

Among its bootlegged peers, though, Kart Fighter reigns supreme. The game positively reeks of effort - all character sprites are original and unique to this game, and are large, colorful, and well-animated. The gameplay isn't perfect, but it's at least existent, which is more than you can say for any other pirated fighting game ever made for the NES. It's actually playable, for chrissake. PLAYABLE! Heavens!

It's not an excellent game by any means, but its mere concept and the decent amount of quirk contained within (dig the game's inexplicably capable and hot interpretation of Princess Peach) make Kart Fighter very much worth playing. If only for a few minutes.

And yes, the game has a two-player mode. Press left or right on controller 2 at the character select screen to enable it. Have a fun!

Description - 
This isn't so much a translation as it is an "improvement" patch. The original game contained a whole bunch of weird (and possibly intentional) spelling errors in the character names, which apparently bugged DvD enough to make him want to fix things up. This patch fixes all the character names you see both during the game and on the high score table, and also makes a few small graphical changes, to further enhance your Kart Fighter experience.

Shame he couldn't do anything about the game's crippling flickering problem, though. Oh well, that's what FCE Ultra's "allow more than 8 sprites per scanline" option is for. You'll definitely want to enable that for this game, kids.
