The unreleased sequal to Zero Tolerance. Palette problems and other bugs are here, but it's a unreleased beta, what do you expect. ;) No one ever thought this would see the light of day, but it has, and it's here. Give it a try. :)

According to wikipedia.org, both games have been deemed by the (now defunct) developer to be publicly distributable as freeware.
