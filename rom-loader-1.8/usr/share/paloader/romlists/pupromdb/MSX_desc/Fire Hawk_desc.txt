The official sequel to Thexder, Fire Hawk has more of everything:  More weapons, more enemies, more music, more levels... more everything.  Some of the main improvements include the ability to save your game at certain points, multiple special weapons, the ability to switch between special weapons during gameplay, and a greatly expanded high-quality soundtrack.
