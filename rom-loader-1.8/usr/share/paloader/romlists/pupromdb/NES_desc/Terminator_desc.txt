All the excitement of the original movie is rolled into one awesome video game for the SNES. Play as Kyle Reese, the hero who's gone back in time to help Sarah Conner escape fellow time-traveler, the Cyberdyne Systems model 101 (AKA the Terminator.) Eventually, Sarah's son will be the leader of an important social resistance unless, of course, the Terminator catches her and ends any hope for human life.

Featuring six levels of white-knuckle gameplay, THE TERMINATOR furnishes you with lots of awesome weaponry and you'll really need every bit of it if you hope to reckon with the hyper-alloy robot chassis and human flesh of your evil friend. Polish your reflexes and lose all sense of remorse--it's time to become a mercenary. Six levels; excitement based on the movie; awesome weapons; cool graphics; two-player action.
