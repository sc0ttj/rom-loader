So you think you're good enough to be on Jeopardy!? Well, here's your chance. GameTek's new Jeopardy! Deluxe Edition featuring Alex Trebek puts you on stage, against computer-generated opponents or up to two friends. Choose a category and an amount, and if you can ring in fast enough with the right answer, you're on your way to becoming the new Jeopardy! champion! Features include digitized photography of the TV studio, contestants, and Alex Trebek himself, as well as Alex's digitized voice and that oh-so-familiar theme music. Over 3,500 questions and answers from TV's longest-running game show will provide you with hours of entertainment, from your very first question all the way to Final Jeopardy!

Directions:

Question the answers to win money. If you question an answer correctly, you get the money amount on the screen you picked. Make an incorrect response and you will lose money. Also, keep in mind that there are Daily Doubles, 1 in the Jeopardy round, 2 in Double Jeopardy, and you can risk any amount of money not exceeding your total with a minimum of $500 in the first round and $1000 in the second round, and you alone can respond to the clue. Then the 3rd round, Final Jeopardy, everyone will wager an amount not exceeding their total and not going lower than $0. The man or woman with the most money at the end of the game wins.
