Road Rashing isn't just a sport. It's an attitude! Road Rash II is the ultimate 2-player racing game with a radically unique split-screen for distinguishing between racers. Cruising cross-country was never this hairy! Spectacular new body-torquing wipe outs! More obstacles to crash into than ever before. Terrorize your opponents on 5 new tracks, each with 5 different levels. Swing a steel chain for some real heavy metal damage! 15 brand new, lightning-fast cycles, including nitro-equipped Super-Bikes!

Directions:

Race and fight your way through the tracks while periodically buying new bikes and watching out for the cops. 

Gameplay:

A motorcycle racing game with an attitude. You race in varying environments for ever increasing sums of money. With that money you can buy faster and better bikes. There are many objects on the road to watch out for, from cars to rocks to signs, if you hit one you'll go flying and loose valuable time. If you crash too often your bike can get wrecked. You can also attack other racers. The default attack is a punch, but some racers have weapons, which you can steal and use against them. The police patrol the various courses, so if you're not careful you can get busted. Road Rash II is not just a racing game but also a fighting game.
