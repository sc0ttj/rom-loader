I've actually been fortunate enough to play this game on cart, with three other people with rahga's amazing four-player adapter. It's a Technos game, which means two things - one, all the characters look like they do in all the other Technos games, and two, it involves these characters beating the hell out of each other. This is why people love Technos games.

You can play two-on-two, or a four-player free-for-all, or a variety of other stuff. You play in a smallish arena, and beat each other up, and whoever's left standing wins. Totally fun! When you die you turn into food, which is really weird. So one of the other characters can actually eat your dead hamburger corpse, and gain back some life. The controls are pretty hard to get used to, but once you do you can really kick some ass.

Translation Description - 
There's a few tiny rough spots in the translation that don't quite give this a "complete" status, but the readme says it's 98% complete, and it's well worth your time, so check it out dammit. It's complete enough for you to play through, that's for sure.

Some happy fun trivia for you - this was released on the same day that Transcore (Magic) released their complete Villgust (SNES) translation. So to promote it, oRdErEDchaos went to all of the messageboards that Wildbill had advertised Villgust in, and replied to all of Wildbill's "RELEASE - Villgust 1.0? messages with a message saying "Not as important RELEASE - Riki Kunio 0.95? or something like that. Naturally this has nothing to do with anything, but it's interesting and I just thought of it, and it's my site so I can do whatever I want goddammit.
