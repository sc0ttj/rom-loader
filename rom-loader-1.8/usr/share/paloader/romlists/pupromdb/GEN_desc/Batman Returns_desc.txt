Live All the Dazzling Action of the Mega-Hit Movie!

Leap with Batman into wild acrobatic battle! The Penguin has Gotham City gripped in his twisted flippers. Track the Dark Knight's most feared enemies through intense search-and-destroy danger!

Attack the deranged Red Triangle Circus Gang with the Caped Crusader's own weapons. Swing on grappling hooks across collapsing rooftops. Pitch deadly Batarangs. Rage down goon-infested streets in the Batmobile. Waylay mobs of street thugs by hurling smoke bombs, wrist-shields and swarms of bats from Batman's Utility Belt.

Dodge Catwoman's slashing claws and swinging kick. Duel with the homicidal Juggler. Fight murderous Gargoyles and machine-gun toting clowns. Then slog through poisoned sewers to a heart-stopping face-off in The Penguin's Lair!
