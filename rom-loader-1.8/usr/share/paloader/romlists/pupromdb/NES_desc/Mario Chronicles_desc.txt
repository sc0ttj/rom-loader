This is the final cut to the game called "Odd Mario Bros. 3? which can be found on many ROM sites. Ringodoggie added some pretty neat ASM changes all well as slick clever level design. People thought that this hack was lost, so now you get to play another great ROM hack. Try the hack out, you'll be glad you did?
