Players adopt the persona of Colonel Scott O'Connor, a military agent who has transferred his brain into raw binary code in order to combat a rogue program in the Main Defense Computer. When Colonel Scott O'Connor enters the system, his body forms the self-image of his ancestors which were Kabuki actors.

Gameplay - 
The field is generally side-scrolling, with a single room with a boss at the end of each level.

Players use their long hair and chip based weaponry to attack enemies inside the computer.

Upon beating the game, a sound test menu is active with a two-frame animation of Scott under his Kabuki guise, bowing. He also states a message to watch for him in his next game, which never came to be.

Plot - 
In the far future, a virus has appeared in the Main Defense Computer of the planet Earth. The origin and nature of the virus is unknown. Scott O'Connor volunteers to undergo an experimental transfer technology that converts his brain into raw binary code. He takes on the image of a Kabuki dancer, since the computer recognizes his grandfather as one. The virus in the virtual world takes on properties of an actual virus-it leaves behind debris, mutant creatures, and parastite enivironments of a biological nature. At the final level, it is revealed that the virus is of alien origin, having been picked up by a lost Hyperion probe launched to a neighboring planet. O'Conner stops it before the virus can order the Hyperion to fire its laser weapons and destroy the human population.

Trivia - 
This game has gained a peculiar currency in popular culture, with oblique references in the TV show Lost, as well as the film Garden State.

In the background of the first person shooter, Soldier of Fortune, a character is briefly seen playing the game.

Similarly, the hairstyle sported by the main playable character enjoyed a small amount of popularity in fashionable districts of Tokyo during the early nineties.
