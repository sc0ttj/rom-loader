You control a small army of guys who increase in rank if they survive each mission. Also more people join you after each mission. Your mission usually involve shooting and killing your soldiers in war fare.Actually I do not think people would care about storyline in a game where people shoot each other and blow up stuff.

Don't wait till you see the whites of their eyes! Don't kid yourself it will all be over by Christmas! Don't try to shut out the screams! And don't forget to wash your hands afterwards. CANNON FODDER. War has never been so much fun!

Hints:

- Laser Trooper -
Press Up, Right 2x, Down 3x, Left 4x, A, Up, B, Down, C, Left, Down, Start at the title screen. Begin game play and use your men to fire three times. Your trooper will spin and disappear. A new laser-equipped trooper named Guido will appear. The laser has the ability to easily destroy most objects. Tanks and other defended targets will require more than one hit though.
