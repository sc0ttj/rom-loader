This is a Wrecking Crew hack where basically all 100 Phases have been edited for new fun and challenging puzzles. Phases range from easy to hard difficulty. The letters and numbers have been edited so they are italicized, but the remaining graphics are left the same to retain the normal Wrecking Crew feel.
