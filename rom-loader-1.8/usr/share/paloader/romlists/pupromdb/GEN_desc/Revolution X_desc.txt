Revolution X is about the ol' Rock & Roll.

There is an evil nation putting the youth down and banning our beloved rock music. Who you gonna call? Aerosmith! With the help of Aerosmith, the player must shoot his/her way through enemy infested levels, (light) guns blazing, collecting power-ups and releasing hostages.

Gameplay:

The game is a standard side-scrolling rail shooter in which the player has to shoot everything on screen to rescue the kidnapped members of the band. The five members of Aerosmith are hidden in the game, and all must be found in order to see the real ending. Each one found adds to the end-of-level-bonus multiplier. The soundtrack consists of several Aerosmith songs continuously looped, including "Eat The Rich", "Sweet Emotion", "Toys in the Attic" and "Walk This Way". Its launch was a success and proved to be a very popular arcade game and was well received by critics and fans alike.

Trivia:

    - Wembley Stadium was the location of the final battle.

    - The game was originally developed to be based on Jurassic Park, but Midway lost the rights of the property to Sega.

    - The NON (New Order Nation) logo is similar to the Nine Inch Nails NIN logo which both have the last N backwards.

    - Aerosmith's car is a black painted Lamborghini Countach.

    - There was also a plan to create a Revolution X game starring Public Enemy, but Midway believed the Aerosmith game lacked sufficient popularity to create another one like it.

    - The Super NES and Sega Genesis ports tone down the blood and the exotic dancers (also played by Kerri Hoskins) who were showing off their thongs have been turned around so they are facing the screen. CD-based console versions feature more blood however, the dancers are still facing the screen.

    - Occasionally after a large in-game explosion, Steven Tyler can be heard saying "Toasty!" in a high-pitched voice; this is a reference to an easter egg in another Midway game, Mortal Kombat II.

    - Most home versions were not light gun compatible.

    - The console versions included loops of Rag Doll for the attract screen, main menu, and score, Fever for the Middle East level, and Dude (Looks Like a Lady) for the ending.

    - A Musak version of Love in an Elevator plays in the elevator part of the Amazon Jungle level.
