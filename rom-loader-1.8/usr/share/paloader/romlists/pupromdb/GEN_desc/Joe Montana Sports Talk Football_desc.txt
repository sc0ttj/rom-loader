Joe's back - now with simultaneous non-stop play-by-play announcing. Control the action on the field and listen to the running commentary from the broadcast booth. It's a whole new game of sound and sight! The field zooms to a dazzling 6X close-up when the players cross the scrimmage line. You see every slamming interception, flying tackle and smash through the defensive wall! Up close and personal! Team up with another guy - you're the quarterback, he's the wide receiver. Call your strategy with over 50 plays in rain/snow, on grass/artificial field. Wide view shows all your receivers at once.

Gameplay:

Sports Talk Football is Sega's second football game on the Genesis, again licensed from San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana.

As indicated by the title, the game's main innovation is play-by-play commentary speech unique to what is happening on the field.

Playing options include exhibition games and a league mode. The game features 28 teams and a playbook of more than 50 plays. Players can also create a "dream team" from all the players in the game and save it through a password.

The action is seen in a horizontal view of the field, which switches to a zoomed-in view once the line of scrimmage is crossed. Two players can play either against each other or cooperatively on the same team.
