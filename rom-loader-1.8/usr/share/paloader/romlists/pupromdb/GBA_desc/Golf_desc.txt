Golf features two challenging 18 hole courses where players are able to play a round of golf, and allows players to choose a club, adjust stance and control the swing. The game features three alternating views; an overhead long-range view of the entire hole, an overhead medium-range view from the ball's current location, and an overhead close-range view of the green. Gameplay modes include 1 player, or 2 player play with a link cable.

This unusual title is based on a cartoon within a cartoon: The Itchy and Scratchy show from The Simpsons. In each episode of the cartoon, Itchy (a mouse) maims Scratchy (a cat) in some horribly gruesome manner. In this game, the characters take their aggressions to the mini-golf course.

You have to help Scratchy both score well on the golf course, and avoid Itchy to survive. The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective, much like a platformer. To fend off Itchy, you can pick up weapons like a baseball bat, or throwing knives.

European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.

The handheld versions of their console brethren still features the PGA license, but is missing the pros and instead uses generic golfers. Additionally, only three courses are available for play: Sawgrass, Summerlin, River High and has four game modes: Practice, Putting, Driving, Skins and Tournament.

The gameplay is similar to many others of the genre, the player is shown an overhead view of the map and then taken to a perspective directly behind the golfer. Using the D-pad to move a cursor on screen to aim their shot and pressing a main button to activate the power/accuracy meter below, pressing once to set the power and again for accuracy.

Each version also has multiplayer capabilities using their respective Game Links (Game Gear has four player capabilities while Game Boy only features two).

Sports Illustrated Golf Classic is one of the many golf games released in the day this one sporting the Sports Illustrated license. Mostly the game is generic with four different golfers to choose from, two amateur and two pros, each with their own degree of skill and difficulty and two 18-course holes to choose from.

Like many other golf games the player uses the d-pad to plot their trajectory and using the main buttons for the power meter. Players can also must adjust to the ever changing weather conditions and can choose from twelve different clubs depending upon the situation. A password feature is also present and two-player capabilities utilizing the Game Boy Link cable.

Ultra Golf is a Golf Sim game, published by Ultra, which was released in 1992.

While this version incorporates the many gameplay options of it's Japanese counterpart, JGTO Kounin Golf Master: Japan Golf Tour Game such as the overhead view, controls and 14 golfers to choose from and five different courses, there are some differences with this American version.

One difference is the branding of ESPN on the label along with their involvement in the game, giving the game the look of an ESPN television broadcast. Also, whereas the Japanese version featured characters that were geared towards anime and had larger heads, this version's characters are more realistically designed to look like actual people instead. It also features the ability to allow four friends to play against each other using the Game Boy Link Cable.\

Similarly to Mario Golf for Game Boy Color, Mario Golf: Advance Tour allows players to create two of their own custom characters and experience golf by progressing through an RPG-like story. The ultimate goal of the story is to make your player climb through the ranks of the various clubs, ultimately reaching the goal of the elite Mushroom Kingdom golfers, such as Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, and of course, Mario.

It's possible to earn experience for either character either by playing through rounds of golf, or by successfully completing various types of mini-games and contests that help you hone your putting, swing, and other golf skills. Distributing experience is more difficult now, as you now have to make sure that both characters are sufficiently levelled up so that you can succeed in doubles matches as well as your solo play.

Advance Tour also links up to Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour for the Nintendo GameCube. By doing this, you can earn even more experience points by transferring your characters over and playing the various modes in Toadstool Tour. Of course, it's also possible to link up to another copy of Advance Tour for GBA multiplayer too.

Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in the 2004 edition of the "best selling pro golf series".

The biggest addition to this version is EA's Game Face, which lets you customize everything and anything. You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more. You may also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs. You also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and "pissed off" animations for when you score a triple bogey.

One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear. You can play for up to twenty seasons. The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent's clubs if you beat them. All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice.

A new feature is the game's ability to read your console's internal clock, and provide you with game modes. If it's near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items specific to that event.

All top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard. Newcomers to the sport have also been added, such as John Daly.

Most of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real and fantasy. One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult course located in Washington.

Like all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports titles. The more EA Sports games you play, and the longer you play them, will increase your EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such as a new driver in Tiger Woods or historic teams in NHL 2004. This feature isn't on the PC version.

Gamers who buy the PlayStation 2 version will be able to play online through EA's matchmaking service. You cannot play online with the Xbox or GameCube versions.

If you buy the GameCube version, you can use the GameBoy Advance to hook up to the GameCube to unlock special rewards not available through normal play.

This compact version of the great and noble game of golf, has the player take control of Tiger himself or other less famous golfers. The player must look out for swing timing and not hook the ball into one of the many bunkers, nor must they underpower the shot or fall short of the fairway. The game of golf is simulated to an accurate level and is both compelling and frustrating, just like the real thing.

http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/tiger-woods-pga-tour-golf
A step back from the Tiger Woods PGA simulation style, Cyber Tiger Woods has a more arcade feel to it, with cartoony style animations, fast gameplay and added elements to make the game of golf more fun then the real life counterpart.

Although real life elements are there, including full motion capture of Tiger himself, recreations of some of the best PGA tour courses, and the full range of moves (putting, chipping, driving, etc.), arcade elements such as 2 player battle mode, zany characters including Little Tiger, and game types that have you aiming to knock down the opposing character from his platform above a poll of lava, and you will soon notice how different Cyber really is.

Other game types include a full practise range, skins tournaments and stroke play. Plus there are hidden characters to unlock, equipment upgrades and power-ups plus trick shots you just won't see on the PGA tour.

Mario Golf on Game Boy Color isn't a straight port of the N64 game - it's a totally different game in its own right. It is a combination of a golf game and an RPG. As in an RPG, you choose your character at the beginning, with various strengths and weaknesses, and throughout the course of the game, your character gains experience points through winning matches or playing mini-games. Experience points can be distributed to various skills, such as putting, which makes it easier for you to do well. There are quite a few skills, and no two characters you can create will play in exactly the same way.

Although the story mode is the main part of the game, there's quite a few other modes to keep you busy, like Tournament, Match Game, Stroke, Training, and the two-player mode via link cable. It comes with a dictionary of all the golf terms you'll need, and an extensive range of statistics on your player.

With 8 courses and a full course architect, you will have plenty of golfing to do. Improved ball physics, improved graphics, even a full simulation mode where aiming and swinging is done for you. If you prefer to do your own "swing", two different swing types are there for you to choose from. All the standard variants like regular, skins, and more. Multiplayer includes LAN play, single-computer turn-based games and the online tournaments (which are no longer active).
