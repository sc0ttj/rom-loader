Zen - Intergalactic Ninja, based on a comic book of the same name, is a story about a militant environmentalist ninja named Zen. He has been assigned by a group of green, pointy-headed aliens to come to earth and stop environmental pollution by any means necessary. Eventually, he will have to find the big polluter, Lord Contaminous. The game play consists of side scrolling and isometric 3D scrolling action. Zen can run, jump, slice with this stick, or use powerups as the game requires.

History - 
"Zen - Intergalactic Ninja" was one of the two NES games that Konami released in 1993, the other being "Tiny Toons 2". 1993 was a year during which systems like the Genesis and Super NES gained more popularity among gamers while the NES didn't receive as much attention anymore. It might be one of the reasons why the game isn't as well-known as most of the other carts Konami made for the NES over the years; it might also be partly caused by the play control, which doesn't initially feel as crisp as it is in other Konami games.

Hints - 

Password for the Last Level
At the password screen enter - Bottle, Tire, Can, Can 

The items you've collected throughout a level are carried over the next; thus, even though you can play the first four stages in any order, it's preferable to start with the easiest (or the one which gives you the most items), as you'll build your power for the toughest areas. The walkthrough below addresses this issue.

When fighting an enemy whose attacks are bombs, blasts, etc., primarily use jabs (press the control pad towards the enemy + B), since their range is more considerable than that of straight-ahead blows (done by pressing B without touching the control pad). 

Instead of running as fast as you can to complete the "slower" stages of the game, always look out for what might fall in front of you.

While fighting bosses, always keep an eye not only on your own life gauge, but also on the bosses'; if you have a lot more energy than he/she does, keep attacking him/her even though you're vulnerable to his/her counter-attacks. If you only have one or two life points left, use a life-regenerating item by pressing SELECT. But if you fight a boss and see that you have no chance of defeating him/her (assuming you have more than one life), don't use life- regenerating items and spare them for your next try.
