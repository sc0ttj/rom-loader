The game is titled Australian Rugby league but, it pretty much covers the major league Rugby world as a whole. In addition to including every team in the Australian rugby league(circa 95 of course) it also includes, all the teams in the European league, world cup teams, and 2 origin teams which I'm guessing are the two original Australian Rugby league teams. I have no clue if the players on these teams are real people or not, but either way there are plenty of leagues and teams to choose from, which is awesome.
