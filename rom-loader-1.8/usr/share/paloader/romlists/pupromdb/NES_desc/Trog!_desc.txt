Welcome to the prehistoric land of Og, where a one-eyed caveman named Trog fends for himself by hunting dinosaurs. In TROG! you have to help Spike and Bloop two dinosaurs avoid becoming Trog's next meal. You'll be on the run through 50 wacky islands as Trog uses his newest inventions fire, the wheel, and the pogo stick to increase his chances of scoring a kill.

Luckily, you can find power-ups to turn the tables, such as pineapples that will turn you into a T-Rex that can flatten your pursuer in one big step! Whether you play by yourself or against a friend, TROG! will put your survival instincts to the test.
