Translation Description - 
A slot machine gambling game that thinks it's an RPG... just not a very good RPG. The game is a spin-off of the Pachio-kun games.

A simple translation hack, I used the game's own uppercase English font. Graphics hacking was limited to adding a small message to the title screen, and changing a single graphic to read 'BOOM' instead of 'BOM'.
