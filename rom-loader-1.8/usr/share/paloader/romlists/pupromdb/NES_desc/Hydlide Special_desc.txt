When Hydlide was released for the Famicom, it was actually given the name Hydlide Special to denote certain enhancements that this version contained over the original. Magic was only introduced to the series in Hydlide 2, but was retrofitted for use in the Famicom version of the original Hydlide. As a result, it plays only a minor role in the game. Hydlide is rather small, and can easily be beaten in only a couple of hours if one knows exactly where to go.

However, players of more modern RPGs will find the experience less than enjoyable for a few reasons. The game's very short tune plays repeatedly without change to many players' annoyance. The combat system takes some getting used-to, and the player's defense rarely ever improves. And last, but not least, the task of leveling up can be quite repetitive, and requires a lot of patience. While Hydlide was celebrated as an evolution in the Role Playing Genre in Japan, it was simply seen as a poor imitator in America.
