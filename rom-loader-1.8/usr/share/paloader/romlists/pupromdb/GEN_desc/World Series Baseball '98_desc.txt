Put yourself into the middle of the pennant race with WORLD SERIES BASEBALL 98. Play as all 20 teams with 700 players thanks to MLB and MLBPA licenses. All of the teams, rosters, and schedules from the 1997 season have been included. A new graphics engine provides the action. All batters and pitchers have stances and wind-ups that correspond to their real world counterparts. As the game progresses, play-by-play commentary will keep you in tune with the action. You won't miss a moment of the action thanks to several new camera angles. WORLD SERIES BASEBALL 98 allows you to play in the majors, but don't expect a Major League salary.
