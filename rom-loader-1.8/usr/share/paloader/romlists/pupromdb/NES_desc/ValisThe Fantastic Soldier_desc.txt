Translation Description - 
One of the lesser known entries in the Valis series is the NES title, which chucks the standard platformer formula of most of the games in favor of a Metroid-like format.

However, the game is *hard*, and mainly because the game has some critical design flaws.. I swear, the single credited game tester must have been high to not complain about these things.
