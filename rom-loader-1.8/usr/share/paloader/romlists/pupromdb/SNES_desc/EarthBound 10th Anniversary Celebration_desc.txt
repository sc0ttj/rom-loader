This hack was made for EB Funktastic Gameplay in the summer of 2005. It commemorates ten years of EarthBoundy goodness with a rockin' Starmen.Net party in Onett's Town Hall. Chill with Reid, Tomato, and a bunch of other wacky SM.Netters as you investigate undercurrents of intrigue and sidequestyness!
