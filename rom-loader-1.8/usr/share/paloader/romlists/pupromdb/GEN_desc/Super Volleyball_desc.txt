Hold Up+B and press A to start the serve, then hold Down+B and press A when the ball turns red to finish the serve.

- Super High Serve -

Hold Up+B and press A to start the serve, then hold Up+B and press A when the ball turns red to finish the serve.

The serve will start like a normal underhand serve but will go straight up into the next screen before coming back down on the opponent's side. This can only be used once per set.
