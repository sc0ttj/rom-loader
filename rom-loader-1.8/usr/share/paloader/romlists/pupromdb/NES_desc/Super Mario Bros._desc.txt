This is the hack of SMB1 with all new levels and the new World A of this game. This is for SMB champions who have already completed World 8 in the original SMB1.

Imagine playing SMB 1 on an Atari 2600. Now you get the picture... It's a really cool concept, and I don't think anyone has done anything like this before.

I knew from the time that I say this hack sitting in the queue that it was going to be one of those quirky hacks that just makes me laugh for no apparent reason. While one could argue that this patch is entirely pointless, which for the most part it is, the concept behind it is somewhat absurd and amusing.

I do have a bit of criticism, however - The sprites and BG graphics are still using their original mappings. For some things which are already block-shaped, like Mario, this works out fine. For others, though, it does not, and they don't look nearly as blockilicious as they could. Ideally the mappings should be edited so everything looks like it's constructed entirely out of stacked blocks. The palettes for some things don't look so hot either, I think those could do with a bit of editing. Also, the new ending text is lame, bitch!

I honestly want to see a version 2.0 of this hack, with edited levels designed to take advantage of this new, block-based Mario reality. Justify its presence on this site, Eclypsis! The hack just barely made it on as a graphics and text overall, go the rest of the way and make it truely complete!

Bowser's jumping challenge is a throwback to old-school platform gaming. It's been specifically designed with the focus on completing difficult jumps rather than defeating enemies. The developer also made sure to keep the game playable, so you won't find any "impossible" scenarios to overcome. As a word of warning, the nature of this game may make it difficult to complete using a keyboard. A gaming controller is definitely highly recommended.

For SMB Hack Contest, according to the title screen.  ~Rx
One of the best SMB hacks of all time

Extra Mario Bros. is not just a typical SMB hack. The gameplay has been altered significantly and is reminiscent of Metriod in many ways, including maze-like level design and even the graphic style. Some Metroid tiles are imported directly as well.

There are multiple new enemies and other modified gameplay elements which will impress even the most jaded SMB hack fan, but what really shows ATA's hacking skill is the final scene with Bowser (available for viewing on Youtube).

This is a must have hack for fans of both SMB and Metriod.

Difficulty - moderate to hard. Fun factor - high but can become tedious if you're expecting straightforward Mario action.

Description - 
New maps, new graphics, new enemies, new powerups, new physics, new final boss. It's practically a new game.

An interesting hack where you star Princess Peach on your search for Mario. This hack combines graphics from SMB2, SMB3, and Yoshi's Island. Jumping and the play control have been hacked as well and feel more consistent with SMB2.

Kabuki - Quantum Fighter
Platform - Nintendo Entertainment System
Region - USA
Media - Cartridge
Controller - NES Gamepad
Genre - Platformer
Release Year - 1991
Developer - Human Entertainment
Manufacturer - HAL America
Players - 1
@END
Players adopt the persona of Colonel Scott O'Connor, a military agent who has transferred his brain into raw binary code in order to combat a rogue program in the Main Defense Computer. When Colonel Scott O'Connor enters the system, his body forms the self-image of his ancestors which were Kabuki actors.

Gameplay - 
The field is generally side-scrolling, with a single room with a boss at the end of each level.

Players use their long hair and chip based weaponry to attack enemies inside the computer.

Upon beating the game, a sound test menu is active with a two-frame animation of Scott under his Kabuki guise, bowing. He also states a message to watch for him in his next game, which never came to be.

Plot - 
In the far future, a virus has appeared in the Main Defense Computer of the planet Earth. The origin and nature of the virus is unknown. Scott O'Connor volunteers to undergo an experimental transfer technology that converts his brain into raw binary code. He takes on the image of a Kabuki dancer, since the computer recognizes his grandfather as one. The virus in the virtual world takes on properties of an actual virus-it leaves behind debris, mutant creatures, and parastite enivironments of a biological nature. At the final level, it is revealed that the virus is of alien origin, having been picked up by a lost Hyperion probe launched to a neighboring planet. O'Conner stops it before the virus can order the Hyperion to fire its laser weapons and destroy the human population.

Trivia - 
This game has gained a peculiar currency in popular culture, with oblique references in the TV show Lost, as well as the film Garden State.

In the background of the first person shooter, Soldier of Fortune, a character is briefly seen playing the game.

Similarly, the hairstyle sported by the main playable character enjoyed a small amount of popularity in fashionable districts of Tokyo during the early nineties.

Now that Ghosts have invaded the Mushroom Kingdom and Mario is gone, Luigi in on an adventure to save the Mushroom Kingdom from his greatest fear. He'll also encounter zombies, Panser plants and the Phantom who makes Luigi's life miserable. You'll also find that this hack has two endings, one good and one real. And the music has a sad creppy tone to it. So if your craving for a challenge, help Luigi end this nightmare?



This hack to me is very special to me cause it was insipred by Mikachu's Mario Panic 4. Luigi from SMAS SMB is the star. And this hack is yup...challenging, don't go insane & don't complain about the difficulty of the hack, it'll make you strong if you finish it. ;) 

Game A and Game B? WTF?

There's two versions of Luigi's Chronicles, Game A is the regular hack that plays like Super Mario Bros. Game B makes the enemies act different and you get a new power up, there are two endings in this hack. The Good ending and the Real ending. Enjoy Luigi's Chronicles everyone.

This is the final cut to the game called "Odd Mario Bros. 3? which can be found on many ROM sites. Ringodoggie added some pretty neat ASM changes all well as slick clever level design.

A complete hack of SMB1 in which you play as the Sandman, who is on a quest to find the sand he uses to make people fall asleep, as he has lost them. He will travel through the realm of dreams, full of nightmares and fever dreams. This game is rather challenging and requires a lot of precise jumps and timing. Have fun!

Mushroom Nightmare is a hack of the classic game, Super Mario Brothers. It features completely revamped graphics, along with major level editing throughout the game. It also features a new storyline, as the brothers aren't trying to save the Princess anymore, it's the Chancellor they're after.

Bowser has taken the Mushroom Chancellor hostage, and is using his power to warp the landscape to his wicked desire. His forces are all over the land, and the Brothers must come to the rescue again, before the King of the Koopa forces the Chancellor to forfeit his powers to him. This game takes place right after the original SMB.

The brothers now have different abilities! Mario, being the one that previously rescued the princess, is more experienced of the two. He is able to jump higher than his brother. However, due to his larger mass, it takes a longer amount of time and distance for him to stop, after a sprint. Luigi plays exactly like Mario, or Luigi from the original SMB.

A graphics upgrade for Super Mario Bros. that brings the graphics up to the style seen in Super Mario Bros. 2 the American Version. There are various graphic patches. This patch can only be patched without graphic and TSA changes.

http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/222/
This release (20090219) is the second official beta test of the Super Mario Bros. Special for NES port. SMBS is a SMB based game licensed by Nintendo and created by Hudson Soft for the Japanese PC8801 computer. It was later ported to the Sharp X1. However, beyond these (now) obscure platforms, it was largely ignored and forgotten until suddenly becoming a cult hit in the emulation scene.

The game became notorious for it's fiendish difficulty and it's (unusual for a Mario game) use of single screens rather than smooth scrolling. The suggestion was made to give the game a facelift and expose it to a wider audience by porting it to the NES. This is the result of that effort.

This is a hack of our old-time fav Super Mario Brothers 1 for the NES. Mario has been abducted by Cyber-Ridley and taken to Zebes, and Samus' mission is to save Mario so he can go back to Mushroom Land to save the Princess.

The hack was created by me and took just a couple of months. Specifically, I've worked on this project from December 2003 to February 2004. Every level and almost all graphics has been changed from the original game. The fireball movement has been changed as well!

This is the true version of Strange Mario Brothers - The Lost Levels.

NOTE - In worlds 3-1 and 6-2, you're going to have to find the vine to find the flagpole, but in 3-1, it's not so hard. In world 6-2 though, it's in the last block that's above the tenth pipe in the level.

Super Greyscale Brothers is a complete palette only hack of Super Mario Brothers 1. Changes the entire palette from nes color to only 6 grey nes variant colors.

Mario decided it was time for a vacation, so he went to the Tofu Kingdom for some rest and relaxation. One of the sites he was going to visit first was a famous play where the most beautiful Geisha in all the land performs. When Mario buys his ticket he notices a big ball of light coming from the sky and crashes right into the hall where he was going to watch the play. When Mario arrives at the hall he sees people running out in a panic and some people already dead in a massacre. When Bowser sees that Mario is at the Tofu Kingdom he takes the famous Geisha along with her three uncles, and flies away into the sky. One of her other uncles was lying on the floor and tells Mario that Bowser has gone into the Exile Valley, he also warns Mario that people who went there has never returned. So before he dies, he gives Mario a map where the Valley is located. So now Mario is in a new land, with a new quest, while he's on vacation?

Super Loco Spoof! is a Smb1 hack that was being made while I was working on my other hacks in progress. You'll notice that there's a couple of changes in this hack, like the ability to shoot while being small. Hard players will get their fix since the levels are challenging. So if you have what it takes, help Mario save the Geisha.

http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/140/
Super Mario Bash includes all new levels (all 8 worlds) and new graphics. I find most Mario hacks to be too hard (by making them super-hard they get away with only changing world 1?), and not actually fun, like it's supposed to be. So my levels are more like what you'd find in a real Mario game.

BTW, I borrowed some graphics from the Japanese Mario 2, but I think there's a little bit from other hacks as well. It's been 5+ years since I made it so I can't remember for sure, nevertheless find and contact the original authors to ask for permission. Hope it's not a problem.

This is an old SMB hack that was being worked on by Challenge Games back in 1999 to 2002 (you can find the old demo at Zophar's Domain) This hack was long forgotten and someone needed to finish it, so here it is. There's also a HTM file with this patch that talks about this hack from the original authors.

So here's the final version of Super Mario Bros. Challenge, a tribute if you will, to The Challenge Games Community. Enjoy the hack everyone. :D

One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the Koopaa tribe of turtles famous for their black magic. The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom People were turned into mere stones, bricks and even field horse-hair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.

The only one who can undo the magic spell on the Mushroom People and return them to their normal selves is the Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the Mushroom King. Unfortunately, she is presently in the hands of the great Koopa turtle king.

Mario, the hero of this story (maybe) hears about the Mushroom People's plight and sets out on a quest to free the Mushroom Princess from the evil Koopa and restore the fallen kingdom of the Mushroom People.

You are Mario! It's up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic of the Koopa!

--From the NES Super Mario Bros. instruction manual.

Overview - 
Super Mario Bros. was one of the great classics, and everyone has played it, but we will give you a little insight on the game. Based on the arcade game Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. became one of the most popular games ever. It had decent graphics and was fairly easy to play. You play either Mario Or Luigi, two plumbers that are trying to save the Princess Toadstool of the Mushroom Kingdom from the dreaded King Koopa. Super Mario Bros. was the start of a great series that has continued to this day.

Directions - 
Run, jump, and collect items, but most importantly keep moving. Collect Mushrooms to get bigger and flowers to spit fire. Collect coins to get extra lives.

Nine worlds, containing three levels each, stand between you and your goal. Find secret areas that might let you skip certain levels and save the princess. 

Controls - 
A Button - Jump
B Button - Run, shoot fireballs
Start Button - Pause the game/Start the game
Select Button - Select 1 player, 2 player(or Duck Hunt if playing SMB/DH)

Hints - 
Continue
If you die and lose all your lives, just hold A+B and press start at the start screen to start at the first level of the world you were in.

Extra Points
When finishing a stage you have to jump onto a flagpole as high as you can. To get the highest score possible, be sure to land on the pole as high as possible and try to land on the pole when the clock's last digit is a multiple of three. If you do this, fireworks will go off that give you extra points.

Super Mario Bros. DX is a complete graphics upgrade for Super Mario Bros., based partly on Super Mario Bros. 3 including a combination of directly-imported, modified, and entirely new graphics. Special attention has been paid to color. This hack may be combined with separate level hacks, or (if credited) used as a springboard for your own hacks.

Hello there! You're probably here because you're looking for a fun hack of Super Mario Bros, right? If so, Super Mario Bros HF could be just for you. Perhaps the main focus of SMBHF is the difficulty. Most hacks that redo levels (at least the ones that I've tried) make the game nearly impossible! I've had quite a few games where I couldn't get past the first few levels without savestates. In my opinion, games like these are just not fun. How can you enjoy a game if you have to keep saving after each major jump? I don't think you can.

That is why SMBHF's levels are about as difficult as the original game's. You will NOT find ultra-hard levels in SMBHF; if you can beat Super Mario Bros, you can beat SMBHF. These levels were created for the gamer's enjoyment, not for the gamer's frustration. Each level (1-1 through 8-4) has been changed. Some have been changed moreso than others, but each has been significantly altered.

The lesser focus of SMBHF is graphic changing. Some major graphic changes include - New floor tile, New underwater tile, New "?" blocks, New brick graphics (Borrowed from SMB2J), and others. There are also some minor graphic changes that you may notice throughout the game. (And yes, those lines on Mario's face are longer sideburns.)

If you expect SMBHF to be terribly difficult, you will probably be dissapointed. If you are here to play an enjoyable remake of the original, you should enjoy this game. Thanks for giving SMBHF a try, and I'm sure you will enjoy it! ^_^

http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/93/
100% of graphics updated to look more like SMB3/SMW. There are no other changes, so you can mix and match this with level mods and other features.

This is a hack found on a Japanese site which does a pretty good job of hiding the fact it's a regular Mario Game. It changes the music, graphics, and level structure to be a bit unlike your normal Mario game. While it is relatively short, it is pretty fun while it lasts.

This is an update of acmlm's hack of yesteryear, The Strange Mario Bros. The graphics have been restored to that of the original Super Mario Bros game. This means that they aren't as buggy as those of the original version.

The levels are still the same great ones developed by ACMLM and with the same modifications to the gameplay, this game ought to keep bringing people back for more and more.

Toad's Treasure Quest is my latest SMB 1 romhack. The foundation of this romhack is what makes it special and very fun to play. A fellow romhacker, Googie, put together a rom containing hacks from various open-source Japanese SMB hacks. He then changed all the GFX and sent me the file for a collaboration project. That project ended up dieing unfortunately. But after a couple months, I found myself with some free time and decided to make a new SMB hack using this incredible hack as a starting point.

This hack contained new music, new GFX, conveyor belts, new lead character animations and upside down pipes/piranha plants. None of the levels were actually changed though. So I loaded up SMB Utility and went to town. I created 16 original levels making sure to utilize these cool new features. This romhack is definitely easier than my previous SMB Bowser's Jumping Challenge and the levels flow much more smoothly.

The story involves how Toad came to posses all those useful items in SMB3. In this hack, you search for those warp flutes. Yes, I know Toad doesn't actually give you those flutes in SMB3. Just pretend he finds em and intends on giving them to Mario, but then Toad trips on a Goomba and drops the flutes which then get stolen by Bowser's henchmen.

This is one of those rare SMB hacks out there that have alot of replay value. The object is to find stars in order to reach Boswer's castle, this is a fun hack that will keep you busy most defenitly. And the music in this hack is really good too. The spikes can kill you in an instant, so be careful. If you like SMB hacks then this game is right up your alley?
