And the fun gets rolling with Bug Off!  Yikes!  The bugs are swarming here, there and everywhere and only a strong whiff of DDT can put 'em away.  The object of the game is to control the seven different kinds of pests that are running helter-skelter over everything.  The Army can airlift in more DDT to fill your bug sprayer... but will they make it in time?

The action build to a furious frenzy as an awesome assortment of insects attack anything and everything in sight.  A definite case of "spray first and ask questions later."  All this and hi-res graphics too!
