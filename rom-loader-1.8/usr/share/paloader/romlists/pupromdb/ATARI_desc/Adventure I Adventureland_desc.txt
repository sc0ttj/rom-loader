Adventureland was the first of the Scott Adams text adventures. Using simple two word commands you explored an enchanted world trying to recover 13 lost treasures. 

The game's display was different from other adventure games like Zork in that the screen was divided into two "windows": the room description, exits, and items appeared on the top part of the screen, and you entered commands on the bottom of the screen.

Trivia:
An Adventureland Demo package was released in 1979. It is a sampler of the original game, brought to the market as a retail demo. As a cut-down version it contains 3 treasures.
