Powermonger takes the basic design and concepts of Bullfrog's previous game Populous, and places it in a war context. The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game.  Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.

CHEATS: 

Quick invention:
Instruct your captain to invent an item, then pause game play. Set the game speed to full and wait approximately two minutes. The item will have been invented when game play resumes.

Alternatively, click on the invent option, then click on it again when your mean leave. This may be used to create an instant catapult, but may only be done once per island.

Sheep eating:
Take a single captain to the north section of the map during winter. Leave him at that location and he will eventually shear and eat a sheep.
