NOTHING, NOTHING CAN PREPARE YOU!

500 years ago, the shapeshifter Shang Tsung was banished from the Outworld to the Mother Realm (Earth) for his crimes. There, with the aid of his pupil Goro, a hideous half-human dragon, he was to atone for his crimes by unbalancing the furies of the realm, allowing his master Shao Kahn and his minions to enter the dominion and rule forever.

He was defeated.

He returned to Outworld a failure, facing execution at the hands of Shao Kahn, supreme ruler of the Outworld, the Astral Planes of Shokan and the surrounding kingdoms. With the apparent demise of Goro, his fate seemed sealed. But Tsung told Kahn of his plan for revenge, a plot so evil and twisted even Kahn was persuaded to grant him one final opportunity to redeem himself. He cleverly lured his adversaries to the bizarre Outworld where they would face a new challenge-- a tournament hosted by Shao Kahn himself.

Today, the Tournament Begins... Again!

--From the SNES Mortal Kombat 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

After his defeat in the first tournament, Shang Tsung crawls back to his master, Shao Kahn, and begs for his life. Shang Tsung tells his master of a new plan to take over Earth realm. Shao Kahn returns Shang Tsung's youth and calls forth to the realms to have another tournament, this time in Outworld. Now all the warriors gather and get ready to fight for their homes. Now it is time, once again, for MORTAL KOMBAT!!! (cue techno music)

Mortal Kombat 2 is the sensational sequel to the famous fighting game, with realistic graphics and fighting styles. They looked great on the SNES and every other console these games appeared on. Mortal Kombat was the first game to use real actors as the characters rather then using 8 or 16 bit graphics. The music in this game keeps your heart pumping and ready to fight. This game is highly popular and highly recommended for the fan of the fighting game.

Directions:

Much like the first game, Mortal Kombat 2 is an action packed fighting game that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Play one player and fight your way through to Shao Kahn and save the world, or play with a friend and beat the ever living snot out of each other. To get started is simple: just choose from one of the many playable characters there are to choose from, such as Baraka, Jax, Kitana, Kung Lao, Mileena, Johnny Cage, Liu Kang, Raiden, Reptile, Scorpion, Sub-zero, and Shang Tsung. Each one uses pretty much the same moves, except for their special moves which are usually some sort of projectile made by a combination of directions plus a high or low punch. Fight your way through all characters and the two bosses, Kintaro and Shao Kahn, to beat the game. So sit down, log in, and have fun.
