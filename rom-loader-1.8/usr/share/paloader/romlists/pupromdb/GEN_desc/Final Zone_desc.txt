You are about to be transported 100 years into the future, where wars are no longer fought by missiles and nuclear bombs. With all weapons of mass destruction banned, the latest wave in warfare is the New Age Power-Suit, or NAP - a robotic combat machine which gives the wearer unheard-of fighting ability. Here, you will play the part of Howie Bowie, the finest soldier of the El Shiria Military Nation's foreign legion, leader of the unit called "Undead." You receive your orders via an urgent radio transmission: "Team Undead, occupy and destroy Point A-46K Bloody Axis. Use K-19 Phantom NAP for this operation." Some would call this an impossible mission. But your NAP can be equipped with up to 14 different weapons, out of 20 available - including flame throwers, land mines, and both hand-held and body-mounted firing equipment. With this kind of firepower to command, your only limitation will be your own strategic sense and combat savvy. The ultimate battlefield - the FINAL ZONE - awaits you!

Gameplay:

Players had to traverse various battlefields and destroy a requisite number of specific enemy types in order to proceed to the end level boss. Players could collect a large amount of weapons, but could only equip and use two at a time. Players could equip a primary weapon to the NAP's arm and a side weapon attached to the NAP's back. Doing so would unleash one of two different variations of attack the weapon offered. However, if the NAP suit was too heavily damaged, most of the weapons the player collected previously will be lost as well as the use of their side weapon.
