This is a board game that stars five Mega Man characters - Dr. Light, Dr. Wily, Dr. Cossack, Roll, and Kalinka, Dr. Cossack's daughter. From what I understand, up to four players can choose one of those characters and play a board game, which seems similar in setup to Monopoly. It also appears to have some mini-games, but I couldn't find any.

The object of the game (and again, I'm guessing) is to go around the board enough times and collect a certain amount of cash, so you can win the game. Along the way you'll get items, and get your character replaced by one of the Mega Man boss characters. Seems fun, but having everything in Japanese kinda spoils it.

Translation Description - 
All in-game text has been replaced, along with the appropriate graphics. This makes the game fully playable in English.

This is the Patch with North American names instead of Japanese names.
