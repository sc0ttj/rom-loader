Platform game based on the Disney Animated feature of the same name.

This is a Beta version of the game, development was stopped due to the introduction of newer 32bit consoles and the demise of the Genesis/Mega-Drive. Unfortunately it shows, poor graphics (especially for a Disney game) and sound with poor level design make this more of a curiosity than anything else.
