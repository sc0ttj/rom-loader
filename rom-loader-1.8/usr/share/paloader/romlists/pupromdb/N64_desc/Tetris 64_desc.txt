Tetris 64 (????64?) is a puzzle game for the Nintendo 64. It was released only in Japan in 1998. The whole game is in English. It is the only Nintendo 64 game that can make use of the Nintendo 64's bio sensor which was included with the game.

Tetris 64 offers a few variations on the original Tetris,

    * Tetris - The standard tetris game not differing from the original.
    * Giga Tetris - The normal tetris game, but with oversized tetrominoes which break up into smaller pieces.
    * Bio Tetris - The normal tetris game using the bio sensor. The game is sped up or slowed down depending on the user's heart rate.

One end of the sensor plugs into the extension port on the Nintendo 64 controller, and the other end clips onto the player's ear. The device measures the user's heart rate.
