The world's pulse raced with excitement! Everyone truly believed the conniving Dr. Wily had been stopped for good and imprisoned by the valiant Mega Man. Reporters jockeyed with cameramen for snapshots as the infamous Doctor hung his head while being dragged away in handcuffs. Dr. Wily would soon be behind bars. Or would he?

Dr. Wily was ready for anything. He had known his dastardly plans would end in failure someday, so after six months without contact his laboratory sprung to life. Monitors whirred into action, lights flashed, and the lab control panel booted up. In no time four hidden robots emerged. The robots then began a rampage in search of their master. Wily had done it again. Nothing would get in their way!

The world's racing pulse turned to nervous fear as a city was pummeled. Wasn't Dr. Wily in jail? Why was this still happening? The four robots took no heed to the great robot creator Dr. Light. Mega Man found Dr. Light and the canine cyborg Rush fallen in the streets.

"Dr. Light? Are you O.K.?" Mega Man shouted.

"Mega Man! We have no time," replied Dr. Light. "Dr. Wily is using his robots to cover up his escape. You must go! Follow his spaceship!!!"

Mega Man, Dr. Light and Rush looked on in horror as Dr. Wily's spaceship shot out of the prison. Dr. Wily was on the loose!

--From the SNES Mega Man 7 instruction manual.

Overview:

Wily has broken out of prison! It's up to Mega Man to stop him again. This time around he may get some help in the form of the mysterious robot Bass.

Mega Man 7 was the only Mega Man game made for the SNES, and it was quite rare, so few of us (including myself) have played it prior to Console Classix. It plays much like all the Mega Man series, but with better graphics, sound, and controls. 

Directions:

In Mega Man 7 you still have your faithful companion RUSH and of course your trusty Mega Buster. One new thing to the game is you may purchase certain equipment at Eddie's Cybernetic Support Shop at certain times during the game. Well, I will leave it to you to save the world one more time. Good luck with Mega Man 7.

}Different Shade Man Music
For different music for the Shade Man level highlight
his level, press and hold the B button, and then select
his level. You must not have defeated Shade Man
for this to work.
}Get ProtoMan's Shield
First, go to ProtoMan's room in CloudMan's stage (right
before the outdoor part before the boss, there will be
a ladder. Use Rush to get to it). ProtoMan
will comment about using weapons to find areas. Then go
to ProtoMan's room in TurboMan's stage (this one is at
the very top of the area with the traffic
light platforms; go through the wall just before you
reach the top of the ladder). He will mention something
about the Super Adaptor.

After you go to these two rooms (doesn't matter with
order you go to those), go to ShadeMan's stage.
Continue like normal until you reach the Pumpkin
mini-boss. Shoot the small orange core of the Pumpkin
(NOT the eyes on the outside). After you defeat it, it
will open a hole on the bottom. Go down until
you reach the room with a lone green Sniper Joe. Defeat
the Sniper Joe, and instead of going down the ladder,
go right through a secret passage and enter the
gate you find. If you did everything correctly,
ProtoMan will challenge you to a duel.

Once you defeat ProtoMan, he will give you the
ProtoShield. This can be used at the same time as the
MegaBuster (don't forget to select it), and it will
block many enemy shots (like those birds that hatch
from the egg; let all of them run into the shield and
they will die).
