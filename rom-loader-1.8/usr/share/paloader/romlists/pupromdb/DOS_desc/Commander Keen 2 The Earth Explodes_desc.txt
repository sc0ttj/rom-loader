The Earth Explodes is the second episode of the Invasion of the Vortiocons trilogy. This game was released almost at the same time as the first episode. However, this game was not released as shareware. In order to play this game, you needed to buy the whole trilogy.

The Story

In this episode a Vorticon Mothership is poised above Earth, preparing to destroy every major city within their deadly Tentalus Ray! Keen must sneak aboard the ship and stop each Tantalus team from their terrible task. If he fails, the Earth explodes!

Keen's Mission

As you already know, your mission is to stop these evil bastards from blowing up the earth. In order to do this you need to find and destroy each X-14 Tantalus Ray, powered by cells from the big purple Space Amoeba. You need to find your way in the ship to each Tantaulus Control Room. You start in the ship's galley, and and must find items to help you on your quest. You already have a Vorticion Hyper-Pistol, which has almost no ammunition at all, and ofcourse, the pogo stick from your mars adventure.
