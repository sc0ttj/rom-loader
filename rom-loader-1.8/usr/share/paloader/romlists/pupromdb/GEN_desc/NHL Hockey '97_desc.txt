NHL 97 hits the ice with an all new Skills Challenge to see how well you perform in the Puck Blast, Rapid Fire, Shooting Accuracy and Puck Handling Relay. Fifteen new signature moves have also been added to better reflect the skills of actual pro hockey players. All-time user records are saved to battery along with four simultaneous seasons, and you can play as or against the United States, Canada or European National teams. Returning to the game are: all 26 NHL teams (rosters reflect the 1996 season) and players (with ratings based on the 1995 season); two All-Star squads; configurable penalties; three difficulty levels; line changes; and the ability to create, trade, sign and release players.
