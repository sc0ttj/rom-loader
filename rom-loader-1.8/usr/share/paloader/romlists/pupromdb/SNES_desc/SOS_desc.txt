Mostly inspired by the book and film The Poseidon Adventure, the players must escape the sinking ship Lady Crithania, which gets hit by a gigantic wave and is capsized, all within the time limit of an hour. However, the game is made more difficult by the lack of a visible timer (although it is shown if you injure yourself, in which case you'll lose five minutes) and the fact the ship rotates angles constantly and gradually gets filled with water.

The game features the possibility to play as four different characters, each one with the same gameplay control and same goal, but with a different story.

Each character can take up to seven other survivors, some of which have different value to each character, and all of them have different requirements in how to get to them and how to make them follow the player. Depending on how many survivors the player finds, who they are and how valuable they are to the character the gamer plays as, the ending will vary. Because of the massive amount of possible combinations of survivors at the end of the game, there are technically hundreds of endings to the game.
