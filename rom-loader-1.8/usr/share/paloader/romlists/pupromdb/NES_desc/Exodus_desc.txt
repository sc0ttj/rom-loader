The story of Exodus centers on a quest (back in Sosaria) to destroy the final remnant of the evil Mondain and Minax. Exodus features revolutionary graphics for its time, being the first computer RPG to feature animated characters. Also, Exodus differs from previous games in that players now direct the actions of a party of several characters rather than just one.

Players now battle groups of enemies on a separate battle screen, where the player has to understand fairly complex weapons and magic systems and employ rudimentary tactics in order to overcome each opponent, as opposed to the system in the previous two games, in which the player is simply depicted as trading blows with one opponent on the main map until either is defeated.
