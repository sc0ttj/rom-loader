This seems like a kinda spiffy side-scrolling adventure romp in the vein of Zelda 2, Faxanadu, or Battle of Olympus. Most of the game revolves around jumping and stabbing and exploring. Of course, you run into people along the way who try to pawn their advice and goods off on you. And I think you're looking for some treasure or something. It'd be great if this game had a backstory!

Translation Description - 
Well, Gideon is pretty sure that everything is fully translated. Nobody can get past Stage 6 (hell, I can't get past Stage 1), so he wasn't able to check any further than that. But as far as he knows, it's all done, bug free, and grammatically koescher.
