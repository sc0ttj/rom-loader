Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!

Gameplay:

The Ottifants is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through six worlds: starting with the house, the basement and the garden through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. In addition to this, enemies can be destroyed by stomping on them. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. 

Picking up jelly babies and blasting enemies is not the only way to gain points. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the six worlds. By successfully completing a secret room, the player receives a 1,000 point bonus. Finding all jelly babies in a stage is rewarded with 100 extra points.
