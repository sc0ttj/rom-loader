Mario decided it was time for a vacation, so he went to the Tofu Kingdom for some rest and relaxation. One of the sites he was going to visit first was a famous play where the most beautiful Geisha in all the land performs. When Mario buys his ticket he notices a big ball of light coming from the sky and crashes right into the hall where he was going to watch the play. When Mario arrives at the hall he sees people running out in a panic and some people already dead in a massacre. When Bowser sees that Mario is at the Tofu Kingdom he takes the famous Geisha along with her three uncles, and flies away into the sky. One of her other uncles was lying on the floor and tells Mario that Bowser has gone into the Exile Valley, he also warns Mario that people who went there has never returned. So before he dies, he gives Mario a map where the Valley is located. So now Mario is in a new land, with a new quest, while he's on vacation?

Super Loco Spoof! is a Smb1 hack that was being made while I was working on my other hacks in progress. You'll notice that there's a couple of changes in this hack, like the ability to shoot while being small. Hard players will get their fix since the levels are challenging. So if you have what it takes, help Mario save the Geisha.
