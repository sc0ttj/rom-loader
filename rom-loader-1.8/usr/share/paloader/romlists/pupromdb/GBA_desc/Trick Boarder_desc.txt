Anyone who gets in your way is in for a face full of ice. Trick Boarder, only for the Game Boy? Color, brings the mountain to you! Fight it out with the big boys in the Grand Prix, race against the clock, or challenge a friend. Whether you're busting out tricks like indies, tailgrabs and melancholies, or whipping past the competition as you frind on rail, Trick Boarder has it all.
