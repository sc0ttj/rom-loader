Rainbow Rider

Far away in the middle of the Rainbow Sea, seven islands rise from the salty water. This is where Bubby was born, not long ago, under a brilliant rainbow. Bubby has always been able to make rainbows spring from his hands just for fun. One day while Bubby and his brother Bobby were playing in the woods, Krabo, an old monster, cast an evil spell on the islanders. Bubby knew right away that only he and his rainbow magic could save his family and friends. In order to break Krabo's evil spell, Bubby must explore all seven islands and collect a big diamond from each one. This is the only way he can defeat Krabo. You must help Bubby in his mission!

HURRY BUBBY! After a certain amount of time the islands will sink and there will be no one left to save! Along the way Bubby will have many adventures and get into all kinds of trouble. You must help Bubby make decisions that could determine the fate of all the islanders. Good luck Bubby!
