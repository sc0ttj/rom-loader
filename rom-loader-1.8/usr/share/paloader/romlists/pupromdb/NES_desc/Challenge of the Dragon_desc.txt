Times were once serene in the lush lands of Lorin, long before technology and evil....the evil necromancer Deniwind that is. As a child, this seemingly harmless soul spent his time idly whittling away the hours with magically insignificant spells. Young Deniwind would make an egg float here, a chicken there, or simply conjure a lizard man or two to do this chores for him. Then disaster and puberty struck, rendering young Deniwind a walking testosterone magic machine with an eye for mischief. Some would maintain that wiping out entire villages by accident on purpose was more than mischief!
