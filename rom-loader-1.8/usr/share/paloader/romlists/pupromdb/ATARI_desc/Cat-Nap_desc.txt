Oh no!  Not again!  Can you believe those cats are making all that racket?  And just outside your window!  If you are ever to get back to bed you ahve to take steps, now.  But don't wake the dog, he makes more noise than the cats.  Watch out for the police if it gets too noisy.  A game of skill and chance that will leave you howling for more, after, of course,a good nights sleep.
