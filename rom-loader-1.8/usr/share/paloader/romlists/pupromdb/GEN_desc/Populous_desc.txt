Populous for the Sega Genesis gives you the power to completely control a world, bestowing you with the gift to control natural disasters like volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, and fires. You must also prepare lands for settlement and expansion. The larger the settlement, the more advanced it becomes.

With great power also comes great responsibility, so it's up to you to defeat the forces of evil in a showdown at the Armageddon. You command a group of loyal followers who obey your every whim. Send them into battle, or make them build a castle for defense. It's your decision. 

As you build strength and gain followers, your powers grow and so does your ability to crush the dark enemy. No one ever said being a god was easy, but Populous makes it possible to live out the ultimate supernatural fantasy. Five hundred worlds are yours for the conquering.

Controls:

D-Pad: Move cursor
