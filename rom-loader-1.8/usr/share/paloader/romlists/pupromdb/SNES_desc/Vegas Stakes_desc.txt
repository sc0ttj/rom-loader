This game is a lot of fun if you like casino games. It has roulette, craps, poker, blackjack, and slots. The graphics are well drawn and have very authentic color schemes. A lot of the graphics are still, so they have a lot more detail. The controls are easy because the game gives you a diagram at the beginning, and it's a point and click system. The gameplay is good because it has five different games, and there is attention to detail that gives the game a sense of realism. If you like casino games, be sure to give this one a try.

Directions:

Choose adventure, or multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, you will play with a friend and see who can win the most money. In adventure mode, you will try to win as much money as you can in the first casino so you can become a high roller and move on to the no limit casino. In the no limit casino, your goal will be ten million dollars. When you reach that, you will have beaten the game. In both casinos they have roulette, poker (seven card stud), blackjack, slots, and craps. At any point during the game, you can press select to bring up the menu and go back to your room. When you go to your room, the game will give you a password for continuing your game later. You can also switch games from this menu.

Hints:

Know when to fold 'em

When playing poker, you may get down to a low chip count. When you are in this position, be sure to look at your first three cards and if they are worth it, just go all in, and if they aren't, fold.
