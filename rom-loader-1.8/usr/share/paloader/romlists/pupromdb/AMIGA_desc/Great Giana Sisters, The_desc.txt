The Great Giana Sisters is a 2D side-scrolling arcade game like Nintendo's Super Mario Bros.

After a long and deep sleep, Giana finds herself in a mysterious and evil dreamworld where everything is strange and different. 

In 32 levels, Giana has to fight against bad monsters, huge spiders and lots of other creatures to find a magic diamond that makes it possible to return to her own world.

Withdrawn from sale across all formats shortly after release due to Nintendo's threat of legal action over similarities to their NES game, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, which they alleged breached copyright. Consequently, the original release is one of the rarest commercial Amiga games.
