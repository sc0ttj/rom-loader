Is Earth Doomed?

Aliens have invaded our planet. Their mission - destroy Earth!

In remote corners of the globe, these evil invaders have built four land bases -- each designed to drain Earth's energy and "feed" it to their space station. In just a few days, the power drain will be complete. Then the alien space station will vaporize Earth with a deadly laser blast.

Only you can stop the horror!

You must fight the alien forces, destroy the enemy bases and blow up the alien space station. But how?

Our top scientists have created a special fighter jet just for you -- the F-14VTS. Whether you're soaring over mountain tops at Mach 3, or floating in hover mode, your F-14VTS will measure up to any challenge! It's equipped with a spy satellite viewer that lets you see your plane from above as you fly it. And it's loaded with incredible weapons! Additional firepower is available at your own space station!

Nobody said it would be easy!

These devious aliens will attack you with everything they've got -- from conventional planes and tanks to the most bizarre alien weaponry. You must be ready for anything!

After destroying the enemy bases, you face your final challenge - the dreaded alien space station. There's only one weapon powerful enough to destroy it -- the top-secret Neutron Cannon.

Unfortunately, our scientists haven't finished developing it yet! They're working like crazy in underground caverns to complete the project, but they need your help! (As if you didn't have enough to do!) You must drop much needed supplies to them before the secret weapon can be completed.

Have fun Captain! It's time to fry some aliens!
