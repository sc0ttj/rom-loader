Mainly you will be controlling Moses (I'm not joking, that's where then title of the game comes from, the biblic exodus of Moses) which has to collect all the symbols in the levels and hit the romans (well, at least they seem like roman guys!) in order to advance for the next level. Between each level you will need to answer some multiple answer questions which are related to the main subject of the game, and those that you answer correctly will grant you ''bibles''.

Personally I never understood what those are for (in the game, I mean!), but they must be good! This may seem boring, but the game turns to be quite adictive even since the first level, and when you notice it you will already be playing for hours! Finally, the levels are quite easy to play, and even on your first game you will easily know what you have to do.
