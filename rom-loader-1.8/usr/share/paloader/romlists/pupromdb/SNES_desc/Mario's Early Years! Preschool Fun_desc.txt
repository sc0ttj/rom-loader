Ah, the easy life. For Mario, that is. And that also describes the game. Too easy. Even for a preschool child it's too easy. I wouldn't even dig this game as a 3 or 4 year old. Although the animations are really catchy. Bottom line: Nintendo made a grave mistake making this game. Children of course love playing as the mustached Plumber, but they'd rather see him stomping on goombas rather than bumping his head on a red square.
