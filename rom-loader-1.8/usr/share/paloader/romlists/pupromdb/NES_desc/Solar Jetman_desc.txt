The Golden Warpship was once the most powerful spacecraft in Solar Jetman's galactic fleet. But that was before alien space pirates shipnapped the vessel on its last mission. The Warpship now lies disassembled and hidden throughout the galaxy, with Solar Jetman the only remaining hope for its recovery.

This will be no easy task for our interplanetary hero. Solar Jetman must search through twelve menacing alien worlds in his quest to rebuild the Golden Warpship. Each one filled with savage alien armies, black holes, extreme gravitational forces, warp zones and deadly booby traps. Once Solar Jetman has reconstructed the Warpship, he can forge ahead to meet the final challenge awaiting him.
