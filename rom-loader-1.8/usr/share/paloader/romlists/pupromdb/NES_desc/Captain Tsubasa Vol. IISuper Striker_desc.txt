The basic stuff from the first Tsubasa game is here; you've basically got a big game of Blitzball going on. There's a lot more going for this version though, especially since you can actually see other players now! And apparently there's a lot more plot, that is, a lot more I had to fast forward through before I could actually play the game. Naturally, if you had to pick which Tsubasa Famicom game to play, I'd pick this one. So there.
