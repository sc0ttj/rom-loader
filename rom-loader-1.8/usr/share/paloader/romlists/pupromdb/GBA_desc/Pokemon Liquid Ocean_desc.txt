You start off in Syrnic Town, your brother is a trainer and is not home, and your father, who is a scientist is at his laboratory every day. One day, you notice your father's missing, and you decide to go to Reine City and ask Pryce, one of your father's friends, for a Pok?mon so you can find him. While trying to find your father, you encounter Team Rocket, whose true goal is revealed only partly, but very late in the game. Daisy Oak and a friend of hers are now trying to stop the "Black", and you help them while searching for your father.
