Originally received from coder Elton Bird for review as PD game TENNIS CHAMPS, Amiga Format passed the game on to sister mag Amiga Power for inclusion as a coverdisk and Audiogenic for commercial evaluation. Audiogenic promptly signed the game up for publication and asked it be recoded from AMOS into Blitz BASIC so that more players/tournaments and extra features (e.g. doubles involving human/computer partners, 4 player joystick adapter & joypad support) could be incorporated for commercial release. Within 6 months, the game was released commercially as SUPER TENNIS CHAMPS [Source: Amiga Format preview (Issue 77, Nov 95, p47), courtesy of Amiga Magazine Rack (AMR)].
