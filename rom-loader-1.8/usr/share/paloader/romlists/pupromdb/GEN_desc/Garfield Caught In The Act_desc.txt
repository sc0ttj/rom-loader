Odie scares Garfield while he is watching television, and he ends up falling on the television. In a rushed effort to repair the television before Jon catches them, Garfield and Odie attempt to put the banged up and broken pieces together. They did actually put something together, but it was far from being a real television. As Garfield throws away the spare pieces, they become an electronic monster...the Glitch. The Glitch transports Garfield into the television. Now he must defeat the Glitch and make his way out.

Gameplay:

The game is a platformer, with Garfield being able to attack enemies up close or throw objects at them (the close-range weapons and objects thrown change between each level). There are also two special stages: one that resembles a Whac-A-Mole game, and one in which Garfield flies through a tunnel, trying to grab Pookies for an extra life or continue.
