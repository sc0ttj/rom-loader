You are B.J. Blazkowicz, top Republic spy and terminal action seeker. After building your reputation as a one man strike team, you now report directly to the president, who sends you on perilous missions of paramount importance. Somehow, you always manage to get the job done and get out alive - there's more medals than material showing on your uniform.

These are the chronicles of a series of increasingly deadly missions, culminating with an attempt on the Master State's commander-in-chief, the Staatmeister.
