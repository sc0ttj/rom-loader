Wizardry Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord, Legacy of Llylgamyn, and the Knights of Diamonds were all released in at the same time. They were almost done as one project. They share the same readme file.

They are translated 100% in English with the exception of the password screen. When viewing the password and typing it in, it remains in Japanese. The author was unable to fix this. If anyone can offer assistance with this, he claimed in 2001 he would add it in.
