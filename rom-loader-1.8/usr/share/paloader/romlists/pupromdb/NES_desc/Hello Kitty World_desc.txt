Hello Kitty World defies explanation, as evidenced by my trying to fit this in a category. Is it action? Adventure? Platform? You don't know, do you? Admit it! The gameplay's hard to explain; you can tell from the pics that it doesn't try to be badass, but it still is. The premise is simple enough; you just float around. Really. That's it. You can even try and get the balloons if you want. It's a good idea too, since it makes the game more interesting. But you don't have to. It even has BOSSES, and you can jump on their heads and stuff. There's not much else to say about the game.. Just that everyone needs to go play! Okay that's all.

Translation Description - 
A ton of people worked on this game. InVerse did most of the hacking stuff I think, and basically all of the distribution stuff. See, InVerse wasn't always bad!
