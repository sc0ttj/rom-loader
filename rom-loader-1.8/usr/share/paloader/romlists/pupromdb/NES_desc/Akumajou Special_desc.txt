THE REVIEW - 

Akumajou Special - Boku Dracula-kun, or Kid Dracula as it's dubbed in English, is basically a joke-type game that Konami is famous for doing about their own classics (i.e. Gradius with the joke game Parodius). Unfortunately, this game was not released in the States (maybe the KKK member with the swastika on his head caused that). The game has a bit of a childish or cartoonish atmosphere to it, while maintaining a bit of the Castlevania theme, except for the darkness, of course. Also, you have control of none other then Dracula's son, Alucard (Dracula spelled backwards), or Kid Dracula!

Overall - 

So, Konami has produced a parody of Castlevania, featuring a childish version of Alucard as the star -- and that's how it shaped up to be. Not too shabby. I love this game despite the fact that all the text is in Japanese and you can't get this at your local flea market, since it wan't made for American release! Regardless, it's Castlevania, except you're Dracula's son trapped in Care Bear land with Rock Man-like gameplay. It's a great game to add to your collection, especially if you're a Castlevania fan -- and even more so if you're a fan of Alucard.
