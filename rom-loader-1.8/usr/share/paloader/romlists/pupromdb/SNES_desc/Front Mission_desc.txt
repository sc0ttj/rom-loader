People in the scene go wild over many of the things in Japan. J-Pop. Giant Mechas. Strategy RPGs. Well, Front Mission takes two of those three things (guess which ones), and swirls them together. The combination of giant robots with huge-ass guns fighting in a turn-based strategy environment should satisfy the inner fan-boy in all of us. The graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay is excellent SRPG fare. So maybe you'll like it more than Spinner 8 did. Probably.

The Ziege Gun
In Mission 15, move to the top left-most corner of the map. You will find a weapon called the 'Ziege Gun', which can either be sold for 15000 Huffmann Dollars, or equipped. It has 1x99 damage, and gives 700 exp. on a miss.
