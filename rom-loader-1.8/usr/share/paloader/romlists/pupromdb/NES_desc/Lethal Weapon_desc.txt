Do know what it's all about. That's right. The crazy cop and his almost crazy partner are back to do the city a world of good. It doesn't get rougher or tougher than the streets of L.A., where Riggs and Murtaugh take on every cheap low life mercenary, street punk and dope dealer to get to the real slime behind big-time corruption. How much of your life, your future, are you willing to risk? As Riggs? As Murtaugh? Who's the best man for each of your three missions? Remember, You'll have to use your muscle and your wits. You decide. And do it carefully!
