Trivia:

Wacky Wheels was created in the time when Apogee and Epic didn't like each other. Both companies put messages about the other company and its games in their own games. In an early version of Wacky Wheels if you started it with the parameter /NOFUN the game would put up a message saying: "Searching for epic games on your computer..." It was pulled from the release version though.
