Tecmo Cup Football Game is a 1993 video game published by Sega with license from Tecmo for the Mega Drive/Genesis and released only in Europe. The game greatly resembles the Captain Tsubasa series and games in appearance of characters and gameplay. A similar game was released a year before for the Nintendo Entertainment System under the title Tecmo Cup Soccer Game.

With the success that Tecmo had with the Captain Tsubasa games in Japan, the company was inspired to release a similar game outside Japan, for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. The result was Tecmo Cup Football Game, a Captain Tsubasa clone featuring a nearly identical looking, only avoiding the original Captain Tsubasa characters' and instead replacing them with similar redesigned ones, following characteristics from the German ethnicity (mostly spiky blonde/brown hair and large blue eyes) along with using western names. The Captain Tsubasa game engine was reused.

Features:

Unlike other soccer simulators, Tecmo Cup Football Game plays more like a role-playing game. The player runs around the field normally, but when he comes into contact with an opposing team member, a turn-based 'battle' is initiated. The player then has the option to perform a variety of moves such as dribbling, tackling and shooting, in addition to player-specific moves, some of which are physics-defying and destructive.

Though sporting the addictive novel gameplay of the Captain Tsubasa games, Tecmo Cup Football Game fared poorly in sales due to lack of marketing by Tecmo and its reputation as a mere rip-off [2] of Captain Tsubasa. Thus, this game is virtually unheard of even amongst hardcore fans of the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.
