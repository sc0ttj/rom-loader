One of my favorite movies of all time has to be Army of Darkness. In it, Bruce Campbell? aw hell, if I have to explain to you what happens in Army of Darkness, then odds are you haven't seen it at all. That being the case, begone from my rom hack review, you clod.

There. Now that I've banished the outsiders, the rest of you who've seen the movie (and loved it, no doubt) are all too familiar with just how great it is. In fact, the whole Evil Dead series is pretty nifty. I know what you're thinking - why didn't anyone think to license a Nintendo game for these movies? Well, rom hacker K. Voorhees is about to show you why not?

This is my 3rd hack of Zelda II! This time I tried to go all out, and I think it worked. There have been countless hours put into this hack, trying to make it special, and I hope you see it when you play. :)

This new version of The Legend of Zelda II - The Adventures of Link is a complete remake featuring an all-new overworld and levels. It's definitely a worthwhile play for fans of the original.

This hack is a continuation of the original Zelda II. It was created with one goal in mind, and that is to provide a challenge. Fortunately, there are 3 patches available to download - Easy, Medium, and Hard. This way, if you don't like challenging games, you will have other options to select from.

It will feel like a new game. Most of the overworld has been changed as well as the 7 palaces. There are all new puzzles in every single area of the game and some of them will most likely get you stumped! If you like Zelda II, then you will definitely like this hack.

This Legend of Zelda ROM is a complete graphics and text overhaul that leaves almost nothing the way it was originally. Join Link as he takes on various quests such as finding a lost love and putting an end to the flowery MMMBop palace.

Link has just turned 16, and discovers a strange birthmark on his hand. With the help of Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, Link discovers this mark is the key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an eternal sleep.

In his grief, the prince placed Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. He ordered all female children in the royal household to be named Zelda from this point on, so the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden throughout the land.

Each piece of the Triforce is in a temple guarded by a powerful monster which must be defeated. At the same time, Ganon's underlings are still around and gaining in strength and number. It is said Ganon could be brought back to life by sprinkling the blood of the one who defeated him on the ashes (Link!). There are many faraway locations and towns to visit, with a variety of weapons, spells, and armors to find which will help you on your quest. The Adventure of Link features a battery backup so games can be saved without the need for passwords.

Gameplay - 
The Adventure of Link bears little resemblance to the first game in the series. The Adventure of Link features side-scrolling areas within a larger world map rather than the top-down view of the previous title. The game incorporates a strategic combat system and more RPG elements, including an experience points (EXP) system, magic spells, and more interaction with non-player characters (NPCs). Link has extra lives; no other game in the series includes this feature.

Hints - 
Special save screen
Make sure you have two controllers in. Now on controller 1 pause the game, on controller 2 press up and A at the same time. You will be taken to a menu where you can save or continue. 

Controls - 
A Button - Jump
B Button - Use Sword
Start Button - Pause, bring up Inventory
Select Button - Cast selected spell
