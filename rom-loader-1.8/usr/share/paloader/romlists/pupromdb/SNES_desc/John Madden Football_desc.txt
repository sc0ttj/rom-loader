John Madden football is the best game going. It's exciting, fast-paced, and unpredictable. The coach has put together a professional playbook so you can pit your football wits against a friend's, or against Madden himself.

Easy defense
Take control of your fastest defender and line him up directly in between the offense's guard and center, but a hair above where they are standing. If done correctly, you will not be called offsides when the play begins. The line of scrimmage in Madden 92 is parallel to the feet of the offensive lineman as opposed to the ball, which is why you're able to line up so close to the offense in the first place. When the ball is snapped, you'll usually have plenty of time to blast your defender through the line untouched, and you'll be able to stop virtually every play in the game.
