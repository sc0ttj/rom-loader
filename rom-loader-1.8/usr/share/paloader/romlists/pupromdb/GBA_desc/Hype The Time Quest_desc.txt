In 19 2D platform levels you have to use your sword and jumping skills to find your way back home. In each level Hype has to find objects to progress to the next level. Besides his sword, Hype also has control of a bow, for which he has to buy arrows, and he can cast spells who are taught to him by a wizard.

Whereas the other versions of Indiana Jones' first game in nearly a decade are 3D action adventures inspired by Tomb Raider, this edition is different, being viewed from above in pseudo-3D with multi-directional movement. The plot involves Communists attempting to rebuild an ancient time machine, whose pieces are spread across 19 levels.

There are largely-switch-based puzzles to solve on each one, and different routes through to completing them. Indy is variously armed with a pistol, machine gun, grenades and his ubiquitous whip. Each level has a password, and ends with a clip advancing the story. As well as Soviets, your foes include scorpions, snakes and jellyfish.
