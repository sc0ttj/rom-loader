Set in the future, Roadkill is a racing game featuring all manner of gruesome additions. There are 9 computer opponents in each race, and you must finish in the top 3 every time. Rockets and homing missiles can be collected so as to shoot the rival cars out. The tracks feature inbuilt hazards and treacherous shortcuts

Money is a big factor in all of this - the higher you finish in a race, the more you get; it can be collected during the race; each car you destroy gives you more money than the previous one, as you go for the Jackpot and then the Super Jackpot.

CHEATS:

Here's how to reap big rewards. This technique is reputed to work for some but not all levels. When you are entering a ten character password (e.g. "LQPONTULRI", which grants entry to the second level), exchange the sixth and seventh letters. Doing so will gain big bucks for you when you complete the level.

Level codes:
LQPONTQNJO
LQPONRHCNM
LQPONUPQCK
LQPONTMBCH
