In the year 2010 of Dimension Almanac, there was a mysterious planet named GORDESS which was moving in the darkness of the cosmos for the purpose of mass murder and plunder. Everyone gave up fighting against GORDESS because of its awesome power. One day a brave soldier riding a space patroller challenged GORDESS to fight. People called this space patroller "FINAL STAR", wishing to be saved. You must bring an end to the murders which have been committed for the past 2,000 years.

Overview - 
Star Force is one of my favorite classic games. It's simple, yet highly addictive. Star Force starts easy enough, but as you get higher up into the levels it gets a lot harder. This game had a unique level system. The levels are based on the Greek alphabet. So, in all there are 24 levels. Well, actually, after you beat the game, there is a bonus level justly entitled infinity. This game in near impossible to beat without the save state feature, so I do not suggest trying to beat it legit. Star Force is a great game, so go give it a try.
