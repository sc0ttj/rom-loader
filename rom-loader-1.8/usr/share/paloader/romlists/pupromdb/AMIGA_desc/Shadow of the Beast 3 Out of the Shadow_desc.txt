You play Aarbron, and you must again face Maletoth, the Beast Lord, in order to free yourself from his curse. In order to be powerful enough to meet Maletoth, you need to collect four items: The Skull of Louq-Garou, the Quintessence of Being, Pendek's Mace and the Crystals of Hodag. These four items are spread across four levels: Forest of Zeakros, Caves of Bidhur, Fort Dourmoor, and Nosthomak.

This is the third and final game in the Shadow of the Beast series. In the first game your character was a beast and you belonged to Maletoth as a Beast Messenger. In the second game, you have developed more into a human-like being, but Maletoth and his aid Zelek were not destroyed. His sister is kidnapped by Maletoth and you, Aarbron, seeks out to rescue her. In the third game, you have developed to a human. Zelek was killed when you rescued your sister, but Maletoth is still alive, and he must be destroyed for you to be free from his curse.

The gameplay is a combination of action and puzzle solving, with an emphasis on the latter. Typical puzzles involves levers and chains moving hooks, bridges, and doors.
