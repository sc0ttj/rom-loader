This is a comedy / parody hack of Final Fantasy 5. Unlike most other "spoofs" out there, I have taken every precaution necessary to make sure this spoof doesn't end up filled with lame, juvenile humor.

My four pillars were:

- No crude humor.

- The plot must be better than FF5's.

- The characters must be believable.

- It must be funny.

I hope I have succeeded on all four, but only you can be the judge of that.
