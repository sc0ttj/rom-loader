Description


If you're ready to step up to a realistic racing game, Top Gear Rally 2 is the one to beat. This is the first and only game on the N64 to feature point-to-point rally courses and authentic rally racers from Toyota, Subaru and Mitsubishi. If you survive the rigors of ARSG Rally School, you'll earn racing certification for races around the world, on courses through every imaginable environmental condition. This isn't just simply the most realistic rally game on the planet - it's also the best!


Gameplay

The game's objective is the same as the prior version: race through different locations (like farms, jungles, deserts and mountains) with the possibility of changing the climate (clear, rain, and snow). The game will randomly chose whether it is day or night.

Reception

Top Gear Rally 2 received a review score of 90% in N64 Magazine UK. IGN gave Top Gear Rally 2 an impressive 8.2 out of 10 overall despite little criticism about the sound stating the music was "boring" and the presentation saying the menus were clunky
