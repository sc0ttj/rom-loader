You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe.  However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.

After MicroProse's purchase of Telecomsoft in May 1989, a slightly enhanced version of RICK DANGEROUS was published on the MicroStyle label and allowed the player to choose any of the game's 4 levels. The original Firebird release did not give the player any choice whatsoever of levels.

The original release contained a black and white game poster as well as a RICK DANGEROUS comic strip that was illustrated by Ian Gibson of 2000AD's Robo Hunter fame (see Miscshot scans). 

The U.S. release was distributed by Medalist International.

Interesting information and trivia about the game can be found on game author Simon Phipps' website.

The enhanced version of RICK DANGEROUS was re-released. It is No. 11 in the series of dual format (PC/Amiga) Kixx budget releases. The disk uses a special tri-format system that can support Amiga, PC and Atari ST disk formats simultaneously.

CHEATS:

Continue game play:
Type pooky at the high score screen to continue from the last level played in the previous game.
Your role as Rick Dangerous demands that you stop the Fat Guy and his evil plans to help an alien race take over control of our world. The journey takes in Hyde Park, Ice Caverns, Forest and Atomic Mines. He must solve positional puzzles and memorise the locations of laser bolts and booby traps, as well as avoiding enemies including robots, penguins and nomads. As in the first game, a fifth level is unlocked after you complete the four standard levels.

Rick can climb ladders and crawl through tight spaces. He is equipped with a laser gun and six little bombs, but can also punch with some effect. The controls are very easy to understand: pressing fire+up shoots the gun, pressing fire+down places a bomb, pressing fire+bottom-left/bottom-right makes Rick slide a bomb along the floor in the specified direction.
