Patch contains IPS patch for both Header & non Header versions of the game. This patch translates all textual images into English as well as the Dialogue (using custom Variable Font Width routines). The fontset used in this game was ripped from Tetris Attack as it was most suitable to use.

The only thing that is not translated is the character voices.
