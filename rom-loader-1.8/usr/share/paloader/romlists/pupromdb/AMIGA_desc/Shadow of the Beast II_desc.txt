While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.

You play Aarbron, and you must again face Maletoth, the Beast Lord, in order to free yourself from his curse. In order to be powerful enough to meet Maletoth, you need to collect four items: The Skull of Louq-Garou, the Quintessence of Being, Pendek's Mace and the Crystals of Hodag. These four items are spread across four levels: Forest of Zeakros, Caves of Bidhur, Fort Dourmoor, and Nosthomak.

This is the third and final game in the Shadow of the Beast series. In the first game your character was a beast and you belonged to Maletoth as a Beast Messenger. In the second game, you have developed more into a human-like being, but Maletoth and his aid Zelek were not destroyed. His sister is kidnapped by Maletoth and you, Aarbron, seeks out to rescue her. In the third game, you have developed to a human. Zelek was killed when you rescued your sister, but Maletoth is still alive, and he must be destroyed for you to be free from his curse.

The gameplay is a combination of action and puzzle solving, with an emphasis on the latter. Typical puzzles involves levers and chains moving hooks, bridges, and doors.
