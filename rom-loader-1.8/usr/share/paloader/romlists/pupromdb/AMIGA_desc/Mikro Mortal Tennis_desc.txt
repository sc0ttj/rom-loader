Halfway between "Sensible Soccer" and a comedic version of "Mortal Kombat", this title is still recognized in Europe as one of the funniest and most playable titles for Amiga.

Its gameplay resembles closely that of "Sensible Soccer" and it is played with a single-button joystick. The goal of the single-player mode is, analogously to "Mortal Kombat", to defeat a series of adversaries organized on a vertically scrolling mountain. The goal is to obtain the trophy which also is a dimensional key whose narrative role serves to solve the initial situation as presented in the introductory animated scenes.

Special moves take after fighting videogames and horror movies. The game also features homing missiles and fireballs.

Fully developed in Italy by a small independent team in 1995.

This game was originally set for release in 1996, but was not published at that time despite the appearance of magazine previews/full reviews and a demo on CU Amiga coverdisk #143 (Oct 96 issue). Additionally, a cracked version of the game had been circulated to the scene in 1996 in anticipation of the commercial release. For reasons unknown, the game wasn't commercially published until late 1999 when it was released by Epic Marketing. 

Lead coder, Marco Pacifico, has provided more info. about this game along with some disk images on his website.
