The talisman is lost and an ancient evil threatens to shatter the land of Holm. You must fulfill the prophecy. Complete the eight fateful quests and defeat the Evil Necromancer. Only your sword and daring can bring you victory.

Gameplay:

Probably the title that Microillusions is best known for. You take on the role of three brothers wandering through the magical land of Holm. Real-time interaction reminiscent of Ultima 7. An extremely large world, touted at the time as the largest game world ever created, about 17,000 computer screens worth of terrain.
