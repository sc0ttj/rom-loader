Okay, this game blows. I know that a lot of people spent a lot of time on this game (well not really), and I know that I should be nice and all (NOT really), but the game still blows. Think Hydlide with a sword. And better music. Okay, well it doesn't blow THAT much. You just walk around and kill stuff, and there's no point to any of it, and it's all just so bleh. It's got a day/night cycle, which is sweet, but there's no point to it, and it just goes back to day so quickly anyway, so it just ends up pissing you off. You might gain levels and stuff, and that character creation stuff in the beginning just MAY have some relevance to the rest of the game, but after about five minutes, you won't really give a damn, and you'll go back to playing your stupid Madden games.

Translate Description - 
What's to translate? Look, just be happy that this is finally in English, and try not to think too much about it.

-Update- The patch breaks the ending, which was originally in English anyway.
