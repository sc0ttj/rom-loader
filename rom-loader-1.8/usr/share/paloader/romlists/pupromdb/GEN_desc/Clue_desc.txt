Clue is a classic board game that they turned into a classic video game. This game is a lot of fun to play if you like Clue. It brings back childhood memories when I try to figure out who killed Mr. Body. Was it Prof. Plum, Col. Mustard, Miss Scarlet, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, or Mrs. Peacock? Did they use the knife, rope, candlestick, revolver, lead pipe, or the wrench? Which room did they do it in?

This was always one of my favorite board games as a kid and now it is one of my favorite classic video games! The gameplay is just like the board game. The graphics looked good because most of it is still, which makes it easier to draw. They did a good job of using the same colors that were in the board game. The controls were easy to use in a menu system. Clue is a lot of fun, so if you like board games, give this a try.

Directions:

Try to beat your opponents in figuring out "who done it" in this classic murder mystery! First, look at your cards, the clues on these cards will not be part of the correct accusation. Roll the dice and move to the room you would like to ask about. Just don't forget to get yourself some pencil and paper if you want to play this game. You'll need them to keep track of the clues. Each time you make a suggestion, a clue will be revealed to you, eliminating one of the possibilities you suggested. Eliminate as many possibilities as you can, then hold your breath and make an accusation. If you're right, you win!
