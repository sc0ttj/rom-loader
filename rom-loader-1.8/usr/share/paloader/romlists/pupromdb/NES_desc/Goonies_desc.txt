Here I go yet again with another game released in Japan for the Famicom, but yet not in America or elsewhere. This one is a really disappointing mistake when one considers the popularity of the film in this country. Why it was not released, I really don't know, but it wasn't and the only way you may come across it is if you're lucky enough to find a Supervision cartridge somewhere. This game is normally stock on the 52-in-1. At any rate, allow me to now go ahead with the brief review.

Gameplay - 
Any of you that are familiar with Goonies II (and you should be), will feel right at home with this game and will see how the second upgrades the original. Unlike the sequel, this game focuses more on action and does not involve collecting items to get to different locations. You run straight though the levels looking for items, yes, but not in the same way.

Levels are straightforward. You run around, defeat enemies (staying away from the Fratellis), collect bombs, blow up doors, and get what's inside. There are also secret items hidden around (like diamonds) that you normally jump to locate, but other than that it is pretty simple. When you blow up the various doors you will either find a Goonie, a key, slingshot, or a life potion. You need to find all the Goonies and all three keys on every level to advance. Once you have done this the music will change briefly, and you can go to the exit. This is normally easy to find, as it will have some sort of impassable barrier that you can't get buy unless you've found everything. Beat all the levels and beat the game, really simple. Fans of games like Kid Icarus will enjoy this, but play even for the history value so you can see why Goonies II is Goonies II.

Control - 
Really simple, the control pad does the obvious, as do Start and Select. ''A'' is for jump, and ''B'' is for kick or shoot (slingshot bullets). You can also jump and then kick, but that's all. To use bombs, duck and press ''B.'' You can only store one bomb at a time, so remember this. Bottom line, it's very easy to get used to and the controls are not awkward in the slightest, you'll have no problem with them.
