You're Mark Tyler, and by the year 2006, you've successfully defended your Heavyweight title nine times. In order to determine the best boxer in the universe, the Intergalactic Boxing Federation has invited you to participate in a tournament where you'll face 12 of the greatest fighters in the galaxy. You'll face everything from cyborgs to mutants as you step into the ring for the most important fights of your boxing career. Head to the IGBF Training Ship to get in some quality workouts, because you've never faced opponents like these before.

It's believed that one of your metallic opponents has a left hook that could flatten an entire building! Take advantage of all your boxing knowledge and experience in the ring, and you might just emerge as the Heavyweight Champion of the Universe!

Trivia - 
Soon after the release of Punch-Out!!, Beam Software began developing an official sequel starring Mike Tyson with manager Don King. Originally titled Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch, the game was supposed to take the series into outer space where Tyson would participate in an intergalactic boxing tournament against various space aliens.

The game's production ran into immediate trouble, however, following Tyson's incarceration for the rape of Desiree Washington. Beam changed the Tyson character's name to Mark Tyler and modified King but did little to change Tyson's in-game character sprite.

Nintendo saw the game and disliked it, refusing to publish it due to lack of quality. Eventually, American Softworks Corp. published the title, and the game was released on the NES as Power Punch II, despite the fact that there never was a first Power Punch title.
