A full scale hack of Final Fantasy, nothing remains but the core programming routines. It features all new graphics, music, levels, enemies, text, statistics and more. Think of it as a "Total Conversion" for the NES.

After numerous releases, the hack has come to a state I consider final - All known bugs have been fixed and the gameplay has been polished to the best of my abilities. SRAM files from any versions other than 1.30 or Final will *not* work properly with this release. Sorry, too much has changed.
