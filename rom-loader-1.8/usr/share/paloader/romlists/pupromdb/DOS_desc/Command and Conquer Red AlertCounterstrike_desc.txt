Counterstrike is the first add-on for Command & Conquer: Red Alert.

It adds 16 new single-player missions, 8 for each side. Unlike in the main game, there is no overall campaign to connect the missions and they can be played in any order. Several new units are available in these missions, including the Soviet Tesla tank (featuring a Tesla coil as its weapon), cybernetic super soldier Volkov and his dog Chitzkoi as well as some older units upgraded with nuclear weapons.

The add-on also includes more than a 100 new multiplayer maps and new Frank Klepacki music tracks.

As a hidden bonus, a small "Giant Ant" campaign is included, featuring combat against gigantic mutated insects in true 50s B-movie style.
