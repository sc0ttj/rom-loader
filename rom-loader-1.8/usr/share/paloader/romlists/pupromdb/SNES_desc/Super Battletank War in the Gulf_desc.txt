Take control of an M1A1 Battle Tank on the front lines of the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait, and you are a tank commander of the coalition forces sent to stop him in his tracks. Your mission is to send Hussein's troops scurrying home like bugs. Take out enemy tanks, helicopters, and SCUD missile launchers, in order to stop Hussein's invasion and prevent further casualties to your allies.

Tips:

Super Battletank

Move around Faster
Instead of moving at the slow, normal pace, switch the screen to map mode, and drive your tank from there to get around a lot faster.

Super Machine Gun
Fire you machine guns at a target, and as the bullets are hitting the target, pause the game. If the object is red when you pause the game, the bullets will keep hitting the target and destroying it without costing you bullets, or your tank.
