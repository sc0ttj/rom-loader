It's batter-up and time for Tommy Lasorda's version of Pro-Ball. Whether you're infield or outfield, at the plate or on the mound, stealing bases or catching fly-balls, the competition is hot and you're even hotter now that you're playing with a big leaguer like Lasorda. And you've got control. Curve balls, fastballs or sliders are some of the wind-ups you'll pitch to outwit your batter. But be prepared when he connects, you'll have to think fast to make your players perform like a well-oiled machine. Are you up for a single, double, or even triple play? It all depends on how you throw the ball. But don't worry, you'll get your chance at bat. This is a race for the Pennant, so you better hope Tommy's on your side. Now take your pick, choose your line-up and let's play ball!
