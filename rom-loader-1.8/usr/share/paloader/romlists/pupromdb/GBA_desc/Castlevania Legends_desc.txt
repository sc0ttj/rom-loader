One of the things that put me off about the Gameboy CV games was the slow walking speed of the protagonists. While I understand this was due to the old school Gameboys blurring very badly when ANYTHING moved, in the age of emulation it's just a pain in the ass.

Therefore, I hacked Castlevania Legends so Sonia moves faster than usual.

In v1.0, Sonia moved as quickly as when Burning Mode was activated. Due to complaints, I slowed her down a little (By using a different method to hack her speed), so Burning Mode still provides a speed bonus along with its other benefits.

Take a journey to the very beginning...to when Dracula first rose up to terrorize the good people of Transylvania. None dared challenge him, and the people of the country lived in fear and terror. Until a young girl rose up and decided to take matters into her own hands.

That young girl was Sonia Belmont, the first in the line of the legendary Belmont clan. And now, her fate lies in your hands.
