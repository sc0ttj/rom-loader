Starfleet Academy - Starship Bridge Simulator is a video game for the Super Nintendo and Sega 32X systems which was released in 1994 by Interplay, the same group which produced many later Star Trek starship games. It did not have a large following, as its interface was not considered easy to use, and had relatively simplistic game mechanics.

Nevertheless, it marks a significant item in this genre, as it was a crucial prelude to the more widely known PC game Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, and to many of the more well-known starship games which followed. It was the first Star Trek computer game of significance to appear as a starship simulator in the modern age using graphics, after a long absence and decline in such games, during the decade following the age of text-based DOS games.

Win Mission #000: Kobiyashi Maru
To win in the Kobiyashi Maru mission, you do the following.  First, enter the codes for 'Secret Cadet Names' and
'Star Trek Series Names'. Choose the names 'James T. '  and 'Kirk' for your cadet names. Next, play the game through like normal. When it comes time for the Klingon Birds of Prey to attack you in the Kobiyashi Maru scenario, open hailing frequencies to the Klingons. The Klingons should respond sounding surprised, then offer escort through the Neutral Zone to the Kobiyashi Maru.(This is the absolute only way to win in this no-win situation, but it's not necessary to beat the game.)
