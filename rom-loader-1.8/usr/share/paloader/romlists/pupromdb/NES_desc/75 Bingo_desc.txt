"Let Bingo Be Bigons"

Gameplay - 2/10

The gameplay is incredibly slow to get started, and does not pick up at all once you get going. If you are not happy with the first time you played, do yourself a favour and do not even play on. One can only bet 1 credit at a time which is really pathetic for a slot machine. Increasing a bet means throwing additional credits into different rows and then in the end one can have five credits bet on each row. Why would I want to do that? The game should really give an option to give more slot control, higher credit betting and so on. The double up game is a sub-game within the slot machine. One would think it is there to increase your credits. Credits are free anyway by the way. Instead by winning five in a row of this mini game you are presented with a girl slowly losing clothes, who had the idea to make this part of a slot machine game?

Graphics - 3/10

Graphics are the best thing about this game by miles, but that is still very poor. The symbols look a little amateurish and the entire slot machine lacks features and the usual bells and whistles one would expect from the slots. The double up game leads to low-res pictures of women losing more and more pieces of clothing. I did not even expect this in the game, even with some of the other games Sachen have produced. And I do not see the point in having that bonus game included.

Sound - 1/10

Plain horrible. You will have to endure the wheels turning screeching each time you play. Way to turn this off? Not really, your TV remove is the best and highly recommended method. Think about it, would you want to play a slot game if the wheels would make a high-pitch noise all the time?! Surely not! The terrible sound effects even beat the graphics and gameplay to the worst-part-in-a-Sachen-game reward. With sound turned off, it can just about be bearable.

Overall - 1/10

If you enjoy punishing yourself with bad games, this is the one for you. Not quite on par with 'Honey Peach' but in a league on its own of annoying sound effects a game can feature. Five minutes into the game you will most likely regret having started it, however. Not recommended, AT ALL.

After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again flourished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet.

These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or centers, of the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction... and now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again!

The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the eight Duke's castles. There you will face the Duke's soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards.

Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return of the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the eternal gratitude of all mankind!

--From the NES 8 Eyes instruction manual.

Directions - 
In the one-player game of 8 Eyes, you control both Orin (the hero) and Cutrus (the bird). In a two-player game, Player 1 controls Orin and Player 2 controls Cutrus. 

Press Up + B to release or recall Cutrus, and Down + B while he's flying, to make him attack. Similar to Castlevania, you can also pick up special weapons with various powers, which you can use by pressing Up + A.

Each level you defeat gives you a new sword, but each boss is only vulnerable to one kind of sword, so you have to somehow find out which order to beat the levels in. According to the 8 Eyes Instruction Manual, 'The sword you start with is weak and only good for a country near France.'

Look! He likes them! Likes them? The boy's Blob loves them! Jellybeans, that is. In every flavor under the subway. Like Vanilla. Apple. Tangerine. Cinnamon. Cola. Coconut. And more.

Like many boys in the twenty-first century, the boy has a buddy from outer space. This one's from Blobolonia - a place where an evil emperor makes everyone eat only marshmallows and chocolate. In fact, for the emperor, healthy things like vitamins are poisonous.

Blob (his full name is Blobert) came to Earth looking for someone to help him defeat the evil emperor. That's how he met the boy.

To defeat the evil emperor they boy and Blob will need a goodly supply of vitamins. And to get the vitamins, they'll need money. To get money, they'll search the underground caverns for hidden treasures and diamond stones.

So what's a boy to do? Just whistle! (That'll call Blob.) Then feed him jelly-beans.

You see, the boy miraculously discovered that not only does Blob love jelly-beans - but that different jellybeans turn Blob into different shapes. And that those shapes can be used to get through many otherwise impossible situations!

With his repertoire of shapes, Blob can help the boy overcome even the most outrageous obstacles - as long as Blob gets the right flavored bean. In fact, with enough jelly-beans in enough flavors, anything is possible.

--From the NES Boy and His Blob instruction manual.

Overview - 
On the planet Blobolonia, the Blobs lived happily on a diet of jellybeans. One day an evil emperor took over and forced the Blobs to eat nothing but chocolate. The Blobs will die soon if they cannot eat jellybeans, so they send a blob to Earth to think of a plan. A boy takes him in as a pet, and now they must foil the evil emperor's plans.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! This game will melt your brain! It's like Myst in the way that you have one big puzzle to solve, but you've got limited jelly beans, so there isn't much room for error. You could get to the end of this game and not have what you need to complete it. Good idea, bad execution.

Directions - 
Use the jelly beans to transform your Blob partner into tools to help you find treasure. Use this to buy vitamins, you'll need them to take care of the bad guys on their planet.

Controls - 
A Button - Toss Jellybean
B Button - Whistle
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Nothing

Hints - 
Brick Wall
- Normally the Blob won't eat Ketchup jelly beans. You can trick him by using one right after you use another kind, such as Honey, then use the Ketchup while he's transforming. The Ketchup bean will turn him into a brick wall.
