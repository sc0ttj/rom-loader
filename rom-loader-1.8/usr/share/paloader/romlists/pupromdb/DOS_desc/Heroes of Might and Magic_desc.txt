Heroes of Might and Magic is a turn-based strategy game in which you play as on of four different heroes: the warlock, sorceress, barbarian, or knight. You must build up your castle by adding different locations to earn different units to strengthen your army with. Units include dragons, cyclopes, phoenixes, paladins, and many more. Your goal is, of course, to destroy you opponents, but this isn't the whole game by a long shot. 

Another aspect of the game is exploring the world your are given and discovering treasures, spells, mines to gather resources, nomad camps, magic lamps, ultimate artifacts, and more.

Trivia:

The game's characters were based on similar characters found in the series that Heroes was spun off from, the Might & Magic series.

This game was strongly based on the King's Bounty game from Amiga computers which is five years older than this game. We could call this game an unofficial sequel to King's Bounty. Though, New World Computing, Inc. made King's Bounty as well.
