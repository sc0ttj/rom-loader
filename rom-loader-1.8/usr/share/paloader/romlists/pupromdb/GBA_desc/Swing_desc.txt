Cranky is hosting the Jungle Jam contest. Before the contest can begin, King K. Rool steals the medallions. It's up to Donkey Kong to retrieve the medals. Players use the L and R Buttons to move left and right and to rotate counter-clockwise and clockwise on pegs. Most of the action takes place on these pegs. DK attacks by either charging up by holding on to two pegs at once or throwing things such as rocks or bombs.

Swing is a Tetris inspired puzzle game: At the top of the screen you see two lines of eight balls ("spheres") in different colors and weights (shown as numbers). At the bottom are four scales. You can transport and put down one sphere at the same time through a grey device between the two parts described above. Three spheres of the same color side by side will disappear and give you points; all other same spheres in vertical or horizontal neighborhood to this three will also vanish (combos)! The clue are the scales because of imbalance they go up or down and can catapult the spheres over the whole area! And there can be highest only eight spheres on one scale pan - otherwise game over. Later in a game there will be more and more colors and special items. The multiplayer mode is even more funny because there you have to make big combos for better items which you can catapult into your opponents area!
