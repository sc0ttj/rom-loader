1885 WAS NEVER LIKE THIS! The time-travelling adventures of Marty McFly and Doc Brown step up the pace for this, the final and most exciting instalment in the Back to the Future trilogy!

Stranded in Hill Valley, back in the Wild West days of 1885, you play both Marty AND Doc in a frantic race against time to return to 1985 --not easy with Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen and his gang of gunslingers standing in your way!

Re-live the excitement of the movie with four thrill packed action sequences taken directly from the film, complete with digitised scenes from the movie and the original movie score!
