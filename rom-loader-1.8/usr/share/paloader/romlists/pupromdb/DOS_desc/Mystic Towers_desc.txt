You are Baron Baldric and you have been asked to enter the Towers of Lazarine to clear them of monsters.

You walk about in rooms of the towers, shooting the monsters with your limited magic and jumping about, moving objects, etc... finally destroying the monster generator.

Trivia:

Version 1.0 of the game was an incomplete version released only to a UK magazine. The first publicly available version of the game was v1.1
