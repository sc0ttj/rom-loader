The nonstop action of Pac-Man enters the 3D realm. Pac-Man World offers you three gameplay modes: Quest, Maze, and Classic. During the Quest mode, you'll enter Ghost Island and help Pac-Man save his friends through six unique worlds. In the Maze mode, there are mazes galore to fulfill your cravings to chase Pinky, Inky, Blinky, and Clyde in a variety of 3D maze environments. The Classic mode is for the nostalgic-at-heart to play the original arcade game that made Pac-Man a legend.
