I was fortunate enough to play this game on cart at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, where Sardius very narrowly beat me. However, I thoroughly trounced him in another game that night, so I guess we're even. If you can call a sound defeat "even."

Anyway, this is a game in the glorious Technos series of games, in which people beat the hell out of each other while doing various things. Think Nintendo World Cup on ice, I guess. Except with a lot more beatings, and variety and stuff. You're the hockey team at school, and you're playing all the other sports teams at school. It sounds odd, but who cares - when you beat a team you get the option of using their uniforms, which also includes the ability to use their special attacks. It's a hell of a lot of fun, believe you me. As you can well imagine, beating your opponent unconscious is one of life's little pleasures, and this game manages to faithfully reproduce that same experience. And the first game is soooo much fun, because you can easily kick their ass. Who says only challenging games are fun?

Oh, and this is the game that was almost going to be released in the States as "Crash n the Boys - Ice Challenge". In case you were dying to know.

Translation Description - 
TransBRC's translation is pretty odd, especially the "Americanization" of a lot of the names. Look out Kunio, here comes Ric! Oh well, it's complete and it's playable, so who cares? Right?
