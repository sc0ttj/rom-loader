Robocco Wars ("Robo Child Wars") is a Japan-only Family Computer game that lets the player control a shape-changing robot named R-10 (and his human controller Lance) as they fights evil robots. On the land, the player is a freight train that must follow the railroad tracks to the boss of the level. However, the robot turns into an airplane when the player is forced to fly to the next mission. Sea missions require the player to transform into a submarine.

Directions - 
Play through 10 stages as a robot that can transform, jump and shoot enemies as a robot, spaceship, and submarine.

The player has three (3) lives and three (3) continues as he struggles to liberate the world of Robocco from evil.

Translation Description - 
This is a complete translation patch for Robocco Wars for the NES. It translates the title screen courtesy of FlashPV, a japanese graphic which I designed and fixes up some engrish. There also appears to be two hidden/unused stages. I would like to see if they exist, but I'm not going to pursue the possibility. Although a level select cheat might do the trick.

What's Left - 
Also one small graphic found in the ROM and haven't been able to find it in the game. It means Sayo-chan with a heart. Let me know if you find it.
