It's just you now... you're alone... no one to turn to for help. Sure, the odds are against you, but this is when you can really show your stuff. You've got your Nintendo Zapper in your hand and a pretty good supply of paint pellets. Don't waste any, 'cause you'll need them all! Your opponents are all around and they're good shots. Whether you're in the dense green woods, the steamy urban ghetto, or the snow covered winter forest, there's only one thing on your mind... survival. Register a hit on an enemy player and mark him with a paint splot. Watch out though, because in this game they shoot back and the only way to be safe is to shoot first and shoot straight. This is the ultimate challenge... dare to take it... try to survive!
