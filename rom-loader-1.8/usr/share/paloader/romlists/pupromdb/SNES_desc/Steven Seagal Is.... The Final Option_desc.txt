Nothing but love for my boy Steven. Dude was in a coma once for 7 years, woke up, and made bodies hit the floor. One for every minute he was in that coma. All while finding the time to have his way with Kelly LeBrock. And I mean the Kelly LeBrock from Weird Science, not the beast from Celebrity Fit Club.

I mean, the man is Hard to Kill. He was Half Past Dead, but now he's Out For A Kill himself. He's Above the Law and now he's Out for Justice.... Urban Justice. The man doesn't even flinch knowing he's On Deadly Ground, in The Belly of the Beast. He's one tough son of a bitch, and anyone else who suffered the attack that left those Exit Wounds would probably have a bum Ticker. He's a one man Attack Force on a Filght of Fury, and God have mercy on The Foreigner when The Shadow Man makes an Executive Decision to strap him to a chair and make him watch The Onion Movie. Waterboarding ain't got nothing on The Glimmer Man.

When your way of life is Under Siege, Submerged, Pistol Whipped and Under Seige 2: Dark Territory, and there's no one left to turn to.....

Steven Seagal is.....

THE FINAL OPTION
