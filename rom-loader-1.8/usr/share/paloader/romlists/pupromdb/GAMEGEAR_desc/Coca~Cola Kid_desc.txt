Quoted from Maxim on the SMS Power! page:

Translated by filler with help from a few others, this is basically a cut-scene translation so you can understand whats going on. The original game is based on a Sonic the Hedgehog game engine but with a somewhat different game mechanic; now you can play through and understand why the kid (?Cokey?) is kicking telephone boxes and jumping around? he has to save his teacher from Team-Evil!
