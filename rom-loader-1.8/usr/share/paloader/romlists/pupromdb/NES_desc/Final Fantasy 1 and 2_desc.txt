Hey, um, it's Final Fantasy! And if that wasn't good enough, there's also Final Fantasy 2! Granted, it's not enough to get anyone excited in the Emulation Age, but this would be quite a worthy purchase back in the day. I mean, who would pay full price for Final Fantasy 2? This way, at least you get the FF1 with it too.

Translation Description - 
Anyway, this isn't too exciting, just the official Final Fantasy translation and the Neo Demiforce Final Fantasy 2 translation. That's all. There was going to be a new intro for the game, but it never happened, so here we are. La.
