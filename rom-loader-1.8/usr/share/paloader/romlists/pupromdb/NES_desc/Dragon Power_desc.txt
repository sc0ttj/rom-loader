This incredible story starts from a place deep inside the mountains, several thousand miles away from the city. Goku and Nora are on a mission to find seven crystal balls. Their trip is filled with adventure, action and thrills. They go through a desert, into caves, and battle monsters. But with the seven crystal balls in their possession, one wish they want will be granted to them by the Dragon Emperor. We wish them good luck!
