This is an overhead-viewed racing game similar in style to Super Sprint. There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.

There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.

Trivia:

The game sold over 100,000 copies in its first year in the UK, a huge amount at the time. The budget price (£1.99) helped, as did great reviews and the popularity of BMX bikes among computer owners.

To celebrate the 18th birthday of Codemasters, they released this game for free on September 18th 2004 as this was Codemasters' first ever published game.

The magazine quote mentioned on the Ad Blurb proved correct, a fact pointed out when the game appeared on one of Codemasters' Quattro compilations. The quote was repeated, along with a note - "It did!"
