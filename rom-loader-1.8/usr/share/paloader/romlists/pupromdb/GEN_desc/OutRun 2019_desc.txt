Out Run 2019 is a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis-only pseudo-sequel to Out Run that takes place in the future. The object is to race against time in a rocket-powered car (with a maximum speed of 682 mph) across five different stages around the world. Like the original Out Run, there is a fork in the road before each checkpoint; however, there can also be forks within a single route.

Out Run 2019 featured four different stages to race across, each one harder than the last. Like in Out Run, at the end of every route, there will be a diverge between the next two routes. Also, throughout most of the stages, some routes will diverge, splitting into two different roadways. Usually, some of the roads will lead onto a bridge over ground, and in some cases, over water. Slipping off the bridges will cost the player precious time.

Sometimes, when the roads split, they will lead to a different kind of road. This is usually seen by means of a three-way diverge sign, which means the player can choose whether to go left, right, or continue forward. For example, on one route in Stage 4, some parts of the road are covered in wet cement. Another features the player driving into a tunnel. The last will lead the player over a bridge.

Finally, there are also secret diverges that can be spotted easily. For example, some areas will have a ramp placed strategically on one side of the road. If hit correctly, the car will fly to one side, and eventually land on a secret roadway. Also, jumping off these ramps can also lead up to overhead bridges on some routes. These secret roads can usually lead to a quicker way to the next route.

Trivia:

Out Run 2019 was originally being developed for the Mega CD/Sega CD as Cyber Road. Development was later moved to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, where it was renamed Junker's High before eventually becoming Out Run 2019. In 2005, Out Run 2019 was re-released as a TV Games device - Play TV Legends Outrun 2019 from Radica Games. One notable thing about it was the included steering wheel controller.
