For the kingdoms of Azeroth the real-time battle between Humans and Orcs continues with Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, the sequel to its highly succesful predecessor...

Warcraft II comes with many new features like fighting not only over land but also over sea and air; SVGA 640x480 resolution graphics with many new 3D-rendered buildings and units; multiplayer play support with up to 8 players, as well as a redbook audio soundtrack and a scenario editor that allows you to design and create your own scenarios--however you need to have Windows 3.1, 95 or better to run the scenario editor although Warcraft II is a DOS-based game.

Trivia:

All of the buildings and units for WarCraft II were originally created from 3d models. Then, after the frames of animation were set, these were given to artists to draw over, giving the game an animated look rather than a 3-D look.
