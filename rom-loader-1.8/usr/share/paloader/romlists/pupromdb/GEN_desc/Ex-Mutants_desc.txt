Leaping from the pages of the popular comic book come the Ex-Mutants. Choose Shannon or Ackroyd as you weave your way through the nuclear wasteland to battle the minions of the evil Sluggo and restore the human race!

Hints:

- Cheat Mode -
Enter the options screen. Set the ''Music'' option to ''05'' and the ''Sound FX'' option to ''21''. Highlight ''Exit'', hold A + B + C and press Start. Shannon will say ''Too easy!'' to confirm correct code entry. A new ''Cheater Cheater Mode'' option will appear, which allows level selection, maximum lives, full energy, and unlimited weapons. Note: Only one of these options may be enabled at one time.
