Situation Report:

Communication satellites destroyed. Disruption of global information flow seriously damaging world economy. Analysts expect further economic and political deterioration.

Terrorist organization Geldra claims responsibility. No demands have been made. At this time, Geldra's motives are unknown. Intelligence indicates that rogue arms merchant Gimdo may be involved.

We offer the standard contract and disclaimer. Your controller will be JC-KAL, authorization code OMEGA. You will be contacted. Looks like a tough one.

Good Luck.

End Message

After reading the message you try to concentrate on the Bach playing in the background but you're troubled. Images of the previous missions creep through your mind; the adrenaline, the smell of gun powder, carnage...

The phone rings.
"Albatross?"
"Yes."
"It's started again."
"I know, Leila."
After an awkward pause she hangs up. As you oil your 9 mm, you prepare yourself for the task ahead of you.

Gameplay:

Set sometime during the 1990s, the Geldra organization (now known as Neo-Geldra and led by a new leader named Gimdo), thought to had been destroyed during the first game, returns and are destroying several of the worlds' satellites in outer space. Like the previous game, the player takes control of a member of the Interpol's fictional Rolling Thunder task force. Up to two players can now play simultaneously, while a single player now has a choice between former damsel-in-distress Leila (as Player 1) or returning hero Albatross (as Player 2). Although outside their different visual appearance (including different handguns), the two characters otherwise play the same.

The graphics are noticeably improved over the previous game and have a decidedly more futuristic look to go along with the game's modern setting. The game's common enemy character, the Masker, which were previously designed to look like hooded terrorists or KKK members, are now cyborgs. Like wise, the game has more varied stage designs, with the first four stages taking place in a seaside resort in Florida and the last four stages in a pyramid in Egypt (both locations are actually camouflaged Geldra bases).

The player's character are armed with a default pistol that has only limited ammo. When bullets run out, the player's gun will fire a slow chase bullet instead. The player can also upgrade to a semi-automatic rifle by entering marked doors. When entering one of these marked doors, a counter will displayed showing the remaining bullets left to be picked up (allow one player to leave ammo for the other). There are also hidden power-ups such as time extension and life recovery behind certain unmarked doors. Specific weapon like flame thrower and a "spread laser" is available at certain mission.
