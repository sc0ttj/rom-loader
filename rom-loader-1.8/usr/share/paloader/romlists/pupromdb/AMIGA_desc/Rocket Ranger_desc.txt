In the 1940s, the Nazis built a base on the moon and plan to use a mysterious substance called Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.

CHEATS: 
Rescue the professor as this slows down the nazis, they can't use him to increase their efficiency.  You will waste valuable time unless you rescue him from the zeppelin while he is over the atlantic shooting the gunner in the gondola is tricky, the best method being shoot below the gunner and move left and right until you are on target.  Gradually move up until you hit the gondola. When you hit it there is a flash, stop firing and after a few seconds you'll be inside the gondola.

Find the supply of lunarium before the fort knox supply runs out, so infiltrate the nazi base which recieves lunarium from the moon. It is in south america or africa, once infiltrated, your agent there will cary on sending you lunarium throughout the game.  You will have to storm the nazi base first.
