This zip file comes with two patches. The STMUSIC.IPS file changes the menu music to a much less annoying tune. Trust me, youll want that patch. The SYLVANTL.IPS file contains the untouched? English translation, for you purist freaks.

The screenshots are all from VERY early on because I kept forgetting to save my game. And the screenshots really suck too. But it gives you a good idea of how sweet the game is. Go play the game.

Recently, Gideon Zhi has teamed up with z80gaiden to improve the patch, and hopes to soon offer a new release with an improved script, a VWF, two-line item names and translated map graphics.
