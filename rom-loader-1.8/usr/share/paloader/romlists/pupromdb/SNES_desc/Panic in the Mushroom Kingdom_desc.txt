This hack is worth playing simply due to its originality! Be warned however that some may find its content offensive. If you are not easily offended, it is hilarious with its use of violent imagery, such as the numerous squirming, bleeding Toads impaled on stakes in a graveyard as shown in the screenshots, not to mention that Morton's Jail has to be the single most disturbing level ever created for a Mario game! There are also many drug references, a hidden evil Kirby world, and if you can find it, an Adults Only Palace of Hentai. This hack is very fun and is about the same level of difficulty as the original. It features awesome graphics rips, music and overall feel from Super Mario Bros 3, custom blocks, overworld and sprites. Even the credits have something interesting and unexpected in them! So, if you don't have a problem with some morbid humor and twisted creativity, this is the game for you. Enjoy.
