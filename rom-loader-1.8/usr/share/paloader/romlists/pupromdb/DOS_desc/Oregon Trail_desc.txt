As a covered wagon party of pioneers, you head out west from Independence, MI to the Willamette River and valley in Oregon. You first must stock up on provisions, and then, while traveling, make decisions such as when to rest, how much food to eat, etc. The Oregon Trail incorporates strategy and planning ahead along with discovery and adventure as well as action (hunting and floating down the Dalles river).

Trivia:

In the manual it states:

"The forerunner of The Oregon Trail was the original Oregon program designed by MECC and released on the MECC Time Share System in 1975. Adaptations for microcomputers and subsequent revisions were released in 1981, 1983, and 1985. The most recent major revision, upon which this IBM/Tandy version is based, was created by a MECC design team that included Tim Anderson, Philip Bouchard, Charolyn Kapplinger, Shirley Keran, John Krenz, Roger Shimada, Steve Splinter, and Bill Way. This IBM/Tandy version was created by Charolyn Kapplinger, Ed Gratz, Mark Paquette, Larry Phenow, and Julie Redland.

If you stocked up on a lot of oxen, the trip to Oregon could be made in record time!

The newest version of the Oregon Trail, called 'Oregon Trail 3rd Ed' is not done by MECC, but instead by the Learning Company, of Reader Rabbit fame. The hunting portion has been changed from the great 3rd person view to a lackluster 1st person.
