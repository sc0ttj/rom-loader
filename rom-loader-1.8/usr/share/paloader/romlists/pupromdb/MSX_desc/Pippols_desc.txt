peter ippol - Simple yet addictive game (10-11-2004 10:33) 

This game offers an amazing gameplay even and especially when if your mind is altered by certain substances. Many nice features, such as
- collect all silver coins to get boots that speed you up
- collect all gold coins to get boots that enable you to jump over hedges
- choose a different way at the end at each level to find your favourite path to the so called "holly gem"
- return the gem home safely
