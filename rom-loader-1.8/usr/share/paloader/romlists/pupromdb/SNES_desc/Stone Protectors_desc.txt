Stone Protectors features 10 levels in which the heroes - Clifford, Cornelius, Chester, Maxwell, and Angus - battle The Predators throughout their mission to retrieve Zok's crystal and bring them all back to the kingdom. Weapons can also be acquired but only used by certain characters. Depending on the difficulty setting, the game's ending scene also features different music in which the Stone Protectors are seen performing as a band.

The game has received moderately positive critiques in terms of crisp graphics, pleasant music, and accurate collision detection. One the other hand, Stone Protectors' plot and the repetitive nature of beat 'em up titles has led to criticisms of blandness. In December 1994, GamePro gave Stone Protectors a 3.5 out of 5 rating.
