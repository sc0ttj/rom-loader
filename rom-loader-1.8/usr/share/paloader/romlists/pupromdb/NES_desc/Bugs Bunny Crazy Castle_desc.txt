Welcome to the Crazy Castle! Listen, Doc, it's up to you to guide me, Bugs Bunny, through the castle and rescue Honey Bunny. But don't think it's going to be easy! Those rascals Daffy Duck, Sylvester, Wiley Coyote, and Yosemite Sam have captured Honey Bunny and hidden her deep within the castle. Along the way we have to collect all the carrots while avoiding those rascals. OK, Doc, let's get going!

--From the NES Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle instruction manual.

Gameplay - 
While presented in a side-scroller format, Crazy Castle differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Bugs Bunny did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Bugs avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Because most NES game cartridges lacked the ability to save, passwords can be used to start at a certain level in this game.

Version Differences - 
The US and European games were modified versions of the Japanese Famicom Disk System game Roger Rabbit. Roger Rabbit is the game's playable character, all the villains are all Who Framed Roger Rabbit-related, and hearts are collected. The Game Boy version is actually called Mickey Mouse in Japan and the villians and music are all Mickey Mouse-related.

This is the first hack ever to change the levels of The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle, for the NES. The first, and the best! All 60 stages are changed, including the 4 special stages. The game starts pretty easy, but gets quite difficult by the end!

The Ultimate Second Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle! Sixty all-new levels for you to trudge your way through. The game doesn't start as mind-numbingly simple as the first, but on the other hand, it also never gets as difficult as the firsthands up if you felt Level 58 was impossible in that one
