Shredder Just Picked Up a Woman

Sunday evening. You're sittin' around the sewer watching your main reporter, April O'Neil, do a live remote from the Statue of Liberty. Then it happened. A humunguso flying android screamed out of the sky and ripped Lady Liberty from her foundation, sending hundreds of freaked out tourists into the harbor below.

"No way!" cried Raphael. "Way," replied Donatello. "And I'll bet you all the pepperoni in Little Italy who's flying that heinous scrap heap." Leonardo grabbed his Katana Blades. "Let's pop by our friendly neighborhood Technodrome and pay Shredder a visit."

With the cunning of an ancient ninja warrior, you battle through the first three levels that lead right to the heart of the Technodrome. There you find Shredder controlling the metallic terror by remote. "You've been a bad boy, you bloated bean bag," says Leo. "But it's nothing a good thrashing can't fix." After you defeat Shredder, he goes over the edge, knocking everyone into an activated Matrix Translocation Beam. With a flash you're all sent back in time. Now you have to fight Shredder and his horde of historic hooligans through six levels of utter weirdness. You've read history in class. Now it 's time to rewrite it.

Overview:

The evil Shredder has stolen the Statue of Liberty! What is his evil plot this time?

Sending the Turtles back in time, of course! The Turtles will have to battle through the past and future to find their way home!

Turtles in Time made great improvements over the previous Turtles games, mainly because it was on the Super Nintendo this time. The graphics were updated, with more detailed sprites and backgrounds, making the gaming experience that much better. Very similar to the cartoon series, good animation as well. Also the various stages were each quite different, so you got a look at several backgrounds, not just the same thing with different colors and tile-sets.
