Join Flip the Kangaroo and Mitch the Monkey in their escape from the zoo of the future to join their friends back at the circus.

Race the clock to turn on the tiles of an ever-expanding, multi-screened, scrolling, stepped playfied.  Guide Flip as he jumps on tiles in some levels when whoosh... the whole screen flips upside down; now, meet Mitch hanging from an upside-down version, frantically swinging from tile to tile on the underside of the playfield.  Avoid the relentless zookeeper, flying nets and sticky squares to complete the screen and reach one of First Star's famous reward animations with all the doings under the Big Top!

Great animations, 36 levels of play, 13 different game screens, fully orchestrated music by Jerry White, 1 or 2 player option and more and more... Guaranteed to make you Flip!
