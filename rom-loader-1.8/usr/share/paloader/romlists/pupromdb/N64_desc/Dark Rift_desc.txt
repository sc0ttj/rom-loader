Dark Rift delivers hyper-active 3D fighting with a sci-fi theme! Compete against eight exotic and powerful characters and two very large bosses. Motion captured character animations enhance the realism. The arsenal includes multiple-hit combos, back-crunching grabs, juggles, projectiles, and punishing special moves. Tune into individual character stereo sound tracking. Fight in Tournament, 2-Player or Training modes.


Dark Rift (Space Dynamites in Japan) is a 3D fighting game for the N64, notable for being the first N64 game to use 60frame/s, as well as being N64's first native fighting game. It is also unusual among fighting games in that fights go for a default three-out-of-five rounds, as opposed to the more conventional two-out-of-three.

It was originally conceived as Criticom II, and is the second of three fighting games developed by Kronos Digital, falling between Criticom and Cardinal Syn. These three games have been referred to as the "Trilogy of Terror", due to their rather uniform low-standing with critics.
