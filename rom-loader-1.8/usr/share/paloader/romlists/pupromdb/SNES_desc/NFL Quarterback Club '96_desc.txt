NFL Quarterback Club is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System game series to feature quarterbacks from the NFL. Steve Young and Warren Moon are two examples of who players can use during the game. At the end of a regular game, the referee exclaims "That's the ball game," although this statement has never been used by real life NFL referees.

In 1994, NFL Quarterback Club was released for the Super Nintendo system. The main appeal about the game is that it offers three different types of modes to play in, making it more like three games instead of one. Up to four different players can play at the same time.

The first and perhaps most liked mode is the "QB Challenge". Players can choose from more than 12 of the NFL's premier quarterbacks to take part in a competition. There are four events in the competition. These are Accuracy, The Obstacle Course, Distance and Read And Recognition. Accuracy involves throwing the ball toward targets. The Obstacle Course is a track where the quarterback must jump over hurdles and go around defenders. Distance competition involves throwing the ball as far as possible, while Read And Recognition is the same as Accuracy but only certain targets hold point values. The QB with the highest number of points at the end of all four events is the winner. Each event can also be played individually if a player chooses to do so. Custom quarterbacks can be created to take part in the challenge. As the quarterback improves, his skill level increases.

The second mode is "Play NFL" and features playing a regular football game. Options include preseason, regular season play and direct playoff entry. All NFL teams are available. The player can import custom quarterbacks into a team. He also has the option of substituting quarterbacks from different teams into his. The play control is nice and crisp, and for the time it was released, the game had good graphics and sound effects. The only drawback in Play mode is lack of music and commentary during the game, except for the word "Touchdown!" when a player scores.

The third mode is "Simulation". There are 30 scenarios from previous games that a player must complete. Some scenarios have as little as 10 seconds left in the game, while others begin with over 15 minutes of playing time left.
