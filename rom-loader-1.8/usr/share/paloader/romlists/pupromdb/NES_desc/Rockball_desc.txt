When the world was in Chaos, there was a big fight between the God of Heaven and Evils of Hell. The Evils were captured by the God of Heaven and restrained in four towers with four magic Balls. People have now lived peacefully for thousands of years. As time passed, the magic Balls were affected by the magnetic field and have become loose. At this moment, the Abbot of Sou-Lin Temple senses the crisis, then orders Pan-zo and Pan-lo to recapture the Evils with the four magic Balls.
