This game takes place 18 months after The Black Gate. Batlin, the leader of the Fellowship has disappeared, as well as Iolo's wife Gwenno. A map is found that points to the Serpent Isle where the Guardian is still planning to destroy Britannia. Lord British sends you, the Avatar, and your companions to this new land. Once there, you discover that a great imbalance is upon the isle and it is up to you to fix it. To do so, you must learn the philosophies of the original inhabitants of this land who worshipped giant serpents symbolizing the principles of Order, Chaos and Balance.

Serpent Isle uses virtually the same game engine as the first Ultima 7, with some slight modifications in inventory managment and NPC portraits. The story however, is more linear and also more extensive. In typical Ultima-style there's lots of dialogue with NPCs next to the usual fighting, puzzles and magic.

Trivia:

"Serpent Isle" has a very funny copy protection. If you give wrong answers to Thoxa and to Fedabiblio, all the characters in the game will talk nonsense every time you speak to them. You'll still be able to wander around the game world, but all the conversation will be amusingly absurd. Occasionally, the characters will also shout "Oink!" when you are not talking to them.
