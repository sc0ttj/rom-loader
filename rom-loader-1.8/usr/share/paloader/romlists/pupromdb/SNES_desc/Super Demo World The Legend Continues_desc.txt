This is the Super Mario World hack made by the man who made Super Mario World hacking easy with Lunar Magic, FuSoYa! What started out as just a demo of what Lunar Magic could do, it turned into a full hack of Super Mario World that's complete right to the end. This patch is so expansive it expands the size of the ROM to 48mbits!

It showcases many of the features in Lunar Magic, including the new tile and palette animation feature included in version 1.60. And it has new custom blocks such as screen-scrolling type pipes that are similar to what you'd see in Mario 3.

This truely a great hack! It must be played and experienced to be judged! It's also very challenging! So, what are you waiting for? Quit reading this and go download and play the patch!
