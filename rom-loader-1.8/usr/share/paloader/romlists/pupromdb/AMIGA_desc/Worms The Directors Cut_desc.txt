The sequel to Amiga "Worms". The game format remains the same - you control a small army of four Worms (whose names you can alter) with the sole purpose of blowing up all the other Worms on the map. It's now also possible to customise the battles yet further.

The weapons are more extensive (and destructive) than in the former game, including the first appearances of the Kenny-on-a-Rope, Concrete Donkey, Priceless Ming Vase, Old Woman and Holy Hand Grenade.
