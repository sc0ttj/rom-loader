BBM is a complete overhaul of original Bubble Bobble, with much, much harder stages and some neat graphics and palette changes. Note that it is possible to beat the first 15 levels without a continue, not really that hard, hehe.

All levels have been hacked. Enemy Graphics have been given a facelift or totally changed. Graphics for just about everything else has been edited.
