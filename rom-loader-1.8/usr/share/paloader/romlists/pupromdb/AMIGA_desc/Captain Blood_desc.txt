You play a computer game programmer (Captain Blood) who finds himself trapped in one of his own computer games.  Worse yet, you've been cloned.  Each of your five clones has made off with a quantity of your bodily fluids and is hiding out on a planet somewhere in the galaxy.  Because of your depleted bodily fluids, you're gradually turning into a machine.  You need to find and assimilate those clones before the transformation is complete.
