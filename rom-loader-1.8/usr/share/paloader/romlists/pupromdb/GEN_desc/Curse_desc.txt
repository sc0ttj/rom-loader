Released in 1989 very early in the Mega Drive's life, Curse was anything but a ''hit'' Most wanted to play the likes of Altered Beast and so this enjoyable treasure was lost. Recently, its secrets have been discovered by MD collectors and they now sell for around $30.

Cuse features strange organic creatures and wonderful scroll levels. Add in great themes and boss design and you are on your way to shooter bliss. There's only two problems with Curse, unfortunately they keep this title from obtaining a 10. The biggest prob is the lack of levels. Though extremely fun and full of replay value, Curse only has 5 levels which is discouraging. The other is the lack of ANY plot. There isnt an ending, opening or anything...I dont even know what the games about.

However, these problems are over-shadowed by Curses greatness and result into one of the must-own titles for the Genesis/Mega Drive.

Hints:

- Level Select -
TO execute level select, hit reset, then hold down button A and hit start. This will bring you to the configuration mode, where you can pick the level you want.
