It's humorous, it's got vehicles, robots, an invention system, branching story lines depending on the character, and more. 8 playable characters including 4 on screen at once. It was ahead of it's time in the game play department.

It will make you laugh, it's got depth to it's game play, and it's downright FUN! Any 16-bit era fans owe it to themselves to give this game a go.

Translation Description:

As always Nightcrawler keeps his promises and brings us the full release of Choumahou Tairiku WOZZ.
