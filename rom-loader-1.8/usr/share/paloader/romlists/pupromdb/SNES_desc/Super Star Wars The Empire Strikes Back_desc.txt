Change Intro
On the Game Start, Option, and Password screen, press Y four times. If entered correctly, you will hear a tone.
Select 'Game Start' and press Start. Wait for the title 'Star Wars' to fade off. Then, when the introduction comes on, use the Control Pad and L and R to rotate and scroll the words around the screen. You can also move the Star Destroyer around, too. That is all the code does.

Sound Test
At any time during stages where you control one of the heroes (not during stages where you control a vehicle IE snow speeder or spaceship), press and hold down the following buttons: A, B, X, Y and Down. While holding these, press Start to access a Sound Test. Use Left and Right to cycle through the tunes, press A to select the desired tune and listen to it.  While still playing the selected tune, you can press Start to resume game play. Whatever tune you selected in the Sound Test will be playing in place of the stage's normal music! In effect, you could be in the middle of say, stage one with the boss theme or the ending theme playing instead of the Imperial March! Remember, on stages where you pilot vehicles this code will not work.
