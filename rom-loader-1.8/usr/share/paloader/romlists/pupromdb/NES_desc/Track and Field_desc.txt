Track & Field helped to popularize the button-mashing style of gameplay, in which a player must hit a button on their controller as fast and as many times as possible in order to make their in-game athlete move quicker. This design rapidly incorporated into clones like Epyx's Summer Games. Many contemporary athletics games still use this form of control as a part of their gameplay.
