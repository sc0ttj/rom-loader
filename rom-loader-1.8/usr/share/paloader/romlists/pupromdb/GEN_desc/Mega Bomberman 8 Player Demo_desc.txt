This is the original Bomberman game for the Genesis. According to Eidolon, Factor 5 was asked to do a Genesis port of Bomberman and came up with this 8-player version that used multiple joystick port adaptors. Hudson was impressed, but decided in favor of licensing a local Japanese company instead.

Eight players on the Genesis is impressive enough, and the trademark frantic gameplay is still there! This game's a riot! Compared to this, Mega Bomberman seems rather stilted and awkward.

Trivia:

Also known as the Bomberman Eight Player Hack. I also note in passing that although it was never commercially released, this "ROM" demo is still covered by Hudson's copyright on the Bomberman franchise.
