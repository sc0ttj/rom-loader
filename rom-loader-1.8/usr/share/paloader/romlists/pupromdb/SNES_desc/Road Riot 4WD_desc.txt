The arcade action of ROAD RIOT 4WD has made its way to the Super Nintendo. Now you can hit the track in your favorite heavily armed off-road vehicles and hit the track for intense 4X4 racing like you've never seen before. You'll race on four continents Europe, Africa, Australia, and North America as you try to take the checkered flag and leave your opponents in the dust. Throughout any race, you can clear a path for yourself by any means necessary whether it's by nudging another car off the track or by firing a missile. While in most racing games you're supposed to avoid obstacles, in ROAD RIOT 4WD it pays to hit the obstacles, which can reveal special bonuses and upgrades. And with the two-player split-screen option, you're in for some crazy racing action as you battle a friend for control of the track. So hop in, fire up your engine, and get ready to race with ROAD RIOT 4WD.
