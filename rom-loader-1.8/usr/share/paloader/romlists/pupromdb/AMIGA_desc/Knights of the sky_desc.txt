Based on sighting reports, the Hun ace must be here somewhere... 

You thought as the wind races through the open cockpit while you struggle to hide in the clouds while maintaining a lookout all around. A group of friendly bombers just flew past, and you decided to hang back a bit and see what that would stir up. 

There! A flash of red in the corner of your vision. You are mine this time... you thought, as you turned the craft and advanced the throttle to maximum, and charged the guns. 

Knights of the Sky is a World War I flight combat sim where you pilot one of the 20 different crafts available (each handles differently!) as you engage in simple missions or join a full campaign where you will progress through World War I where you will go on variety of missions, patrols, and even encounter enemy aces. You can engage balloons and blimps, enemy fighters and bombers, even strafe group targets such as supply trains. 

Its main feature is capability of modem link so you can challenge fellow modem owners to dogfights, something that none of its contemporaries had.

CHEATS:

If you're doing badly and your plane is heavily shot, land in a field & keep the engines running.  Drive to a friendly airbase avoiding any trenches.  Enemy planes try to shoot you but always miss, they do however fly in front of you so you can zap them.
