Damn, how much cooler can a game get? Okay, you're this guy that shoots bullets out of this dot in his forehead, and you go around killing those Troll things that were EVERYWHERE back in second grade, remember those? And you even kill helpless puppy dogs! It's a real wonder this game never made it over here. But it still would've been a pretty cool game, even though NOA probably would have changed the dogs into something else.. Probably more Trolls, hopefully. I mean, what else is there to say? It's a pretty fun game. You can charge your shot, and throw this odd trident thing, which you can jump on to get to high places. The monsters drop money when they die, and you can shoot the money and it increases in value, which is just plain neat. It's freaky, and really really cool at the same time, just like all good games should be. OK that's all.

Nothing much to say here. It's a small, quick, complete translation. Download the patch and discover this game's majesty. If that's even the right word. I think it is though.
