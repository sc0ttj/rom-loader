Okay, so I recently started playing this game again after I re-discovered Mighty Max on YouTube. The game's concept revolves around the player's character collecting pieces to some dooms day machine. Now, I first played this game when it first came out, and I played the game on a frequent basis until I realized it was too hard! The game doesn't really tell you how to collect the items, so your forced to walk around until you discover random tools and gadgets that help you. This is especially frustrated since the game was marketed towards to little kids, who may grow impatient at the game's slow pace and infinitely re-spawning enemies.

Despite the game's sub par gameplay, the music and graphics are not that bad, considering the came out in 1995. The music at the main screen is fairly catch, but the game's sound effects are one-dimensional. Probably, the best feature of the game is its two-player mode, allowing you and your buddy to team-up and fight Skull Master's minions. This game isn't really a must have, unless you're a die-hard Mighty Max fan. All in all, the game will keep you busy for awhile, given you don't set fire to it out of frustration. The game has potential, but the aforementioned follies keep it from being a killer.
