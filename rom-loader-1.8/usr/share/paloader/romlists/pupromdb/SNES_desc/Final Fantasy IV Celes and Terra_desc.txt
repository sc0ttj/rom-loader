This ROM hack alters the game into a story mostly centered on characters from at least one other game in the Final Fantasy series, notably Celes and Terra.

The game was modified to a large degree. Both graphics (mainly character graphics) and text were modified. One character was even changed into a totally new character.

The text was changed from a base script of J2E's translation of the game. The game is now more female related. It is also a bit sapphic in nature, centering on the relationship of Celes and Terra.
