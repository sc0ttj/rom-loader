As you delve deeper into the dungeons, you'll become enthralled with the world of Gauntlet II.

Overview - 
Okay, so there's not much of a story here. An evil wizard has built this huge dungeon for some reason, and these four heroes have to get through it... to save the world, I guess? Anyway, it's Gauntlet. The graphics are a hair better in this edition. The graphics look about the same as the first installment with a little more attention to the shadows. The sounds were nice because there isn't much BG music, which I've never been a big fan of. The sound effects were comical at times, especially when you find food. The gameplay is fun just like the original. It's nice to play a sequel and not have to relearn to play the game. The controls are easy to use, but they are a little slow. This game is an enjoyable classic, and if you like Gauntlet, you'll love this chapter in the series.

Directions - 
Choose from 4 different classes of fighters - Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, or Elf. Choose one at the screen using the arrows. They are all pretty much the same, except for the way they look. All the weapons are thrown, there is no melee. The real object of this game is to get to the EXIT. Most monsters will come from a generator, which can be destroyed, which is a good idea! You will find food (refills your life), a key (opens locked passages), or liquor bottles (refills your life). Sometimes you will find a chest, inside you will find either food or the grim reaper who will try to kill you. Don't spend too much time looking for chests though, because your life will always be slowly decreasing, so get to the end of the level quickly!
