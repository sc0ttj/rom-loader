Description

Crave Entertainment has given us an Asteroids game for the 90s, beefing up the classic formula with updated graphics and numerous multiplayer modes. Asteroids Hyper 64 contains 50 levels spread out over five zones. Although the time-tested concept remains the same (blast everything on the screen), players are armed with new power-ups and have to defeat a boss at the end of each level. Multiplayer action includes both cooperative and competitive variations, including team play.
