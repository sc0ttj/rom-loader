Ferrari Grand Prix Challenge is one-player driving/racing game where you play the role of Ferrari team driver. The main objective of the game is to become F1 Champion - during standard 16 rounds season. Your rivals are 25 computer opponents representing different F1 teams (though, maybe of the low budget of game, no real teams, 'cept Ferrari, and driver names are used - all they seem to be made up). Every round consists of qualification(1-lap) and main(5-laps) races. If you phail to qualify, no other chance is given. After every round you're given a password to continue your game with previous results achieved.  

Instead of racing for prizes, you could enter the practice mode, where you can choose the track and number of practice laps. Comes in nifty, when you're aiming for 160/160 season points.
