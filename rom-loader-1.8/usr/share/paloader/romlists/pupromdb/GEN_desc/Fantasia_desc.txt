Fantasia is the title of a side-scrolling video game developed by Infogrames and produced by Sega for its own Mega Drive/Genesis system. The game was loosely based on the popular Walt Disney musical of the same name.

Gameplay:

In the single-player game, you controlled Mickey Mouse through various side-scrolling levels in an attempt to collect various musical notes that somehow went missing. Each level was based on the Fantasia animated musical. You defeated various enemies by jumping on them up or by collecting magical bubbles that you could use to shoot at enemies as projectives. In each level you needed to collect a certain number of hidden magical notes in order for the Fantasia musical to occur.

Trivia:

Fantasia is also the title of an adult arcade game similar to Taito's Qix.
