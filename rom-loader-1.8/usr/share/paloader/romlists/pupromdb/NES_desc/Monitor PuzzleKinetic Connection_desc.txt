Kineko is an innovative little puzzler where you have a moving picture broken into rectangular tiles, and your job is to reconstruct it based on what you can see. You can rearrange the possible tiles however you want in the puzzle above, and you may need to flip them vertically or horizontally. While this seems outrageously taxing the first time you play it, you will soon earn that there is evidence you can rely on to test what should go where.

The game has an hour in the "best time" list, and if your mind wanders or you get frustrated, it will be necessary. Still, if you keep your head and focus on one part of the puzzle at a time, you should do okay. The game also allows for if you oriented the puzzle incorrectly.
