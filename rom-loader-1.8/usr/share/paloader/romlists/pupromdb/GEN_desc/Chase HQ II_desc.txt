The game starts off in the light industrial area of the city with a drug dealer bust, and the highway patrol is just too slow for the job. It's your job to put this guy behind bars. In the next few levels, you travel through tropical beaches, snow-capped mountains, dangerous deserts, and the heavy industrial district chasing everyone from kidnappers to murders. 6 levels may not seem like a lot when you think about it, but once you play the game, you'll understand just how fun they are. You start by just merrily driving through the level in search of your suspect.

Although I suggest keeping the pace rather fast since you need to catch up to him before the first timer runs out. Once you have him in your sights, it's just a matter of not losing him and bumping his car as much as you can. If bumping and trying to keep up with him are too much for you, you can simply use a turbo but be warned, you only get 3 per level so use them wisely. Well, now that you know what the game is all about, you're probably thinking that it sounds pretty boring, but once again, I re-assure you that there is plenty to do in this game.
