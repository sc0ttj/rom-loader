In 1998, while the Sega Genesis was still available in Brazil, a Brazilian toy/video game company named Tec Toy licensed Duke Nukem 3D from 3D Realms, and ported it to the Sega Genesis for sale in the Brazilian video game market. Of course, the Sega Genesis doesn't have the sheer CPU power to run a straight port of the PC game, so it was smashed down and cut up to look more like a version of Wolfenstein 3D than the original Duke3D.

Yet despite all that, you can look at the game and still tell that it's Duke Nukem...
