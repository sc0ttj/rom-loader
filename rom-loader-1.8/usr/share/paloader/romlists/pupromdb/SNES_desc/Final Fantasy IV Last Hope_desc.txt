This is a rather large FF6 hack that I have been hard at work on for quite some time.

Some of the obvious changes are as follows?

 - Increase in difficulty

 - Script changes

 - Changed the dialog font

 - Lots of new monsters (from other games)

 - New Espers

 - New portraits for all

 - Guile (Leo sprite) replaces Edgar, Edgar is Leo

 - Changed who equips certain items

 - New bosses

 - Mature dialog (cussing)

 - A few new Relics, and no more Moogle Charm

 - Hold "B" to sprint

 - Renamed most of the items

 - Custom battle scripts

 - High end magic cost more

 - A lot of the major known bugs fixed (Evade Bug, Vanish/Doom Bug, Rippler Bug, along with many other lesser patches.)

 - Changed some character sprites

 - Czar Dragon enabled

 - Custom title screen

 - A lot of various nerfs & buffs

 - Some graphics restored to original uncensored

 - Auto Bow-Gun reduced damage and can miss

 - Bum Rush damage reduced

 - Ultima and Flare damage reduced

 - Tornado changed so its not so useless

Please enjoy!
