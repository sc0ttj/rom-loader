Gameplay

Gameplay from WWF War Zone was for the most part retained. The previous edition's "Challenge Mode" was replaced by a Career Mode which allowed a player to wrestle as a WWF star. The player would first start wrestling on house shows winning matches to work their way up to RAW, then pay-per-view events and eventually getting title shots as the Career Mode progressed. New match types were also added, including the First Blood Match.

Development

Originally, the game was to include fictional jobbers that players would face early on in the career mode. For unknown reasons, the fictional jobbers were removed from the game, but their voices, ring attire and theme songs remain accessible in the Create-a-Wrestler mode.

Though not playable in the game, The Hardy Boyz did the motion capture for the moves. The intro movie to the PlayStation version includes a dedication to Owen Hart, who died shortly before the game's release, and was posthumously included in the roster.
[edit] Reception

The game received good reviews upon release. IGN gave the Nintendo 64 version a 8.7 out of 10 and an 8.3 for the PlayStation version, lauding the game's many gameplay modes and customization options.[Jeff Gerstmann also lauded the game's presentation, but found fault with the game's vague play-by-play commentary. The Dreamcast version released months later was criticized for not improving much on the original versions.
