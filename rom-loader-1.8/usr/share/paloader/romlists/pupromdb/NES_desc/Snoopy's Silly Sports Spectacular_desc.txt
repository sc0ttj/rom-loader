The Silly Sports are being held in it's traditional home of Italy and Snoopy, from the Peanuts comic strips, will want to attend. Snoopy packs his plane and brings along his relative, Spike as an opponent and the little yellow bird, Woodstock to judge.

Now Snoopy's ready to compete with 1 or 2 players in his own custom olympiad of the following "events" - 
1. The Sack Race - Snoopy and Spike race against one another in competing potato sacks.

2. Boot Throwing - Just like the Hammer toss, but involving an old boot.

3. Pogo - Hop on a Pogo Stick and hop over obstacles.

4. Overboard - Snoopy and Spike play "King of the Boat" trying to knock each other into the water.

5. Pile of Pizza - Balance the pizzas while trying to walk towards the finish line.

6. River Jump - Pole Vault over the river (actually sticking the pole into the river) to the other side.

The Japanese version of this game uses a Donald Duck license rather than a Snoopy license (changing many of the character names above), but gameplay remains the same.
