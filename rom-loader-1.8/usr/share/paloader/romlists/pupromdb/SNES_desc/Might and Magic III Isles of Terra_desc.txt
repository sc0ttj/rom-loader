Isles of Terra is a much-improved sequel to the already great Might and Magic series. The interface has been improved to help you control the game more easily. The graphics and sound, obviously, have been boosted, especially since this was ported to SNES rather than NES.

Once again your mission is to assemble a team of heroes to adventure through the land, defeating hordes of monsters along the way, and finally save the known world from impending doom. As always there are many interesting plot twists, puzzles, and side-quests to solve on your path to the final confrontation.
