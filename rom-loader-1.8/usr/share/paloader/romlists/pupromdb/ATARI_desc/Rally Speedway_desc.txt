Watch out Mario Andretti! Here comes Rally Speedway! A full color car racing simulation for your computer! A colorful, scrolling roadscape serves as an exciting backdrop for fun-injected action. Choose one of the two courses provided or "construct" your own. Players are challenged to hot rod their joystick-controlled cars down grueling straighaways, around hairpin corners and past an ever changing landscape that includes houses, lakes, orchards and more. Work on improving your lap time with a solo game, or invite a friend alone for a one-on-one duel to the finish line. There's plenty of excitement to go around! The action has never been faster, the competition never keener than in this sensational simulation. For flat-out fun, there's only one racing game that really delivers - Rally Speedway! (Relax, Mom - no helmet required!)
