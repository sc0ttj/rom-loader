ZooCube is a puzzle game that involves matching parts of animals to eliminate them and get points. The Cube is a 3D object in the centre of the screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a similar style to Tetris you must keep the sides from building to high. It is a fast real-time game and at later stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminate animals on all sides. Power-up can be used to destroy animal parts, get points or to make life more difficult for your opponents such as by speeding up the rate in which animal parts fall to their cube or reduce how fast their cube can spin.
