Based on the comic book series by Todd McFarlane! In this game, thirteen different kids are kidnapped. Spawn, the anti-superhero, goes and finds the culprit! As you keep playing, you get deeper into the story as it evolves.

Directions:

Kind of like any beat-em-up game. You fight the baddies and use a different variety of moves, such as the chain whip and the Fire Blast! A very challenging game for all, this is worth a look, even if you're not a Todd McFarlane or Spawn fan!

Heal - Hold Block, press Up, then press Down and release Block at the same time

Fire Blast - Hold Block, press Down, Down-Right, Right and Punch (standard Ryu fireball motion). Throws a small fireball in a straight line

Burning Fist - Hold Block, then press Left, Right and Punch. Spawn winds up and throws a HIGHLY damaging short range punch

Tinkerbell - Hold Down, then press Block and any Kick at the same time. A homing star emerges, following nearby enemies. Detonate the star with any button

Full Force Blast - Hold Block, then press down, down-left, left and punch. Four fireballs that mildly track your enemies

Fire Storm - Hold Block, then press Left, Down-Left, Down, Down-Right, Right and Kick. Engulfs you in fire and shoots you straight upward. Very useful for moving yourself up to high ledges
