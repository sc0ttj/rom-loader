Roger Wilco, the brave interstellar janitor who has already saved the universe from many great dangers, is now in a very embarrassing position. His commanders show no respect for his courageous actions in Space Quest 5. Instead, he is being accused of all kinds of violations against the galactic law, is deprived of all the honors he got in the previous game, and as a token of mercy, is allowed to return to his old job - cleaning closets... But those unfortunate events are just the beginning of much bigger troubles Roger will get into. Once again, the future of galaxy depends on him!

"Space Quest 6" is the first Space Quest game to be released exclusively on a CD ROM. It features SVGA graphics and voice-overs. The interface is a bit different from the classic Sierra icon-based one: you choose verbs from a menu, a bit like in earlier LucasArts games. "Space Quest 6" continues the humorous tradition of the series and is especially inclined towards parody on famous sci-fi movies.

Trivia:

When attending Santiago's funeral on the Holocabana check out the graveyard keeper... It's the same one from Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers! Guess he got tired from all that voodoo mumbo-jumbo...

Trivia:

Can't work out what Roger is saying when he does the "Vulgar Nerve Pinch"? If you've set the game to display text, the dialogue provides no help; all it says is "O, mumble ... mumble ... mumble".. So here is what Roger is actually saying is:

"Ohh, boy I got you with my fingers and your Kurt Russell now you can't get awai gotcha now that you gotta ... Hard to believe this is a real job (inaudible sound) Oh, my (inaudible sound). So, how come you're not going tonight I got you with your mumbo-jumbo and your (inaudible sound) Whew, boy, I oughta ... If I only could I would, jeez. If you ... Why don't you step outside, pal? I got you with ... this and the ... Mmm, I think I broke a fingernail here." 

Set your computer date to October 31 and start the game.  Go to 8-rear on the deep ship 86 (by using the transporter) and Sydney's head will loosen from his body and float around in thin air following you around ( as a "scary" halloween joke )

This game was originally written and designed by Josh Mandel, but he left Sierra for management reaons and original Space Quest creator Scott Murphy took over and put on the finishing touches. This partially explains the incosistent nature of some of the puzzles, since Josh and Scott didn't get as much communication done as they should have and certain details in the game were overlooked in the transition.
