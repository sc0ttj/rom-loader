In each stage the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. The game has three difficulty levels - easy, normal, and expert. The difference between the difficulties is the time given for each level (and "expert" has no clock refills to give you extra time).

The pictures are slightly animated images of Waldo scenes, the player has to scroll along the long picture to survey the scape while searching for Waldo and other objects. The directional buttons control a magnifying glass and is used in order to "find" objects. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each level and by finding him the player gets to play a small bonus game to collect points while controlling Woof on a flying carpet.
