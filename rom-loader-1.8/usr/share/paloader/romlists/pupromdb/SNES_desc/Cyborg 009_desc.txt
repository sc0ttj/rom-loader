Cyborg 009 is some kind of anime, I guess. There's these, uhh, nine, uh, cyborgs. Yeah, and they all have special abilities, and they fight crime? and I guess there's some kind of big bad guy that they fight, or something. So to recap, yeah, I've never heard of it.

This game, though, is an amazingly standard run-and-shoot-things action game. Think Megaman, I guess, except you can jump thirty feet into the air, but only for a distance of five or six feet. So yeah, platforming aspects really suck. It's also unlike Megaman in that you don't fight giant robots created by the nefarious Dr. Wily, and you don't get to absorb their attacks and use them on others. Also, your weapon has a very short range, unlike Megaman's famous Mega Buster. Okay, so I just meant "think Megaman" in the sense that you're running around and shooting things. I couldn't think of another example.

Of course, all run-and-shoot-things action games require some gimmick to distinguish it, and in this one you can choose a party of three to fight with, and you can select them with the L button, and also possibly, the R button. They can all do different things, like the bald freak who can change shape into a birdie or an enemy. Stuff like that. It would be a really cool thing to have in a game, but unfortunately this game isn't very good anyways, so there you go.

Apparently savestates don't work with this translation? Other than that, yay.
