Gameplay:

Micro Machines on the Genesis was the same as it was on the NES, except the graphics were better. It's a lot like RC Pro AM in the way that it is played. The biggest difference was that you got to choose your own opponents. There were also a lot of different vehicles you could race, instead of just cars. Micro Machines were really big when I was a kid. I only had a couple, but a few of my buddies had a ton! I think the most memorable thing about Micro Machines is the guy on their old commercials that talked really fast. He was crazy. Micro Machines is a whole lot of fun, so give it a try!
