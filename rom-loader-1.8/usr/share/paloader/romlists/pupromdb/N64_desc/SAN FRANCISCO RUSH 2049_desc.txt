Features

The game is notable because of the high level of detail which went into creating a futuristic version of San Francisco and the fast arcade-style physics. It also provides up to a four-player mode and Rumble Pak support. A major difference in game play, when compared to its predecessors, is the ability to extend wings from your car in midair and glide. A Stunt Mode has been added, in which the player scores points for different kinds of mid-air spirals. There is also a Battle Mode, which is a sort of multiplayer deathmatch. There are 6 Race tracks, 4 Stunt arenas, 8 Battle arenas, and 1 Obstacle course. Generally as the game progresses in circuit mode, the drones become very difficult to beat, and the shortcuts may end up being the only way to place 1st.The hidden shortcuts and jumps add to the replay value of the game. It has a techno-oriented soundtrack.
