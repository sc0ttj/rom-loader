I think this game takes away Umihara Kawase's title as Cutest Game Ever. Although Rhapsody also comes close. Even after watching the opening story, the plot isn't really clear as to why this adorable little princess has to go and take down all these demons or what have you. But, you don't play these kind of games for their story.

You're a princess. Who looks a lot like Little Red Riding Hood except you're, uh, Blue. And you're adorable. Anyways, your goal is to jump around and swing your sword at enemies, until there's no more enemies to swing your sword at. Basically. You also get powerups, that you can use with the A button, and you have your super badass attack, that you use with Select. But basically it's just your usual charming platformer that's really fun to play. Tada!

Translation Description:

Everything's complete. Isn't that font awesome? Yeah it is.

Gideon Zhi says the ending might not show up properly on a copier. Then again, maybe it will. It hasn't been thoroughly tested yet, I guess.
