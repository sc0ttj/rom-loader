This is a hack of Capcom's Mega Man 2 for the NES. The hack isn't a complete remake of the original game, but all levels have been changed to look different from the original ones. The colors have also been changed, and a new title screen has been made.

This hack includes - 
- New levels

- New colour palettes

- A few graphic changes (very few though)

- Various HEX fixes

Version 1,1 (incl. some bug fixes) released on 19 August 2009.

(I feel the need to inform you that Air Man's level is possible, there are ladders hidden in the clouds. Evil.)
