This guy Gen is a carpenter. And he runs around hitting things with his carpenter's hammer. You may know of him as Hammerin' Harry! This doesn't really play like it though. You've got three hammers: one that turns enemies into blocks, one that (temporarily) destroys them, and one that pisses them off so that they follow you around. You have to use these hammers and manipulate your enemies so you can go through the level. So it's got a definite puzzle game kind of feel. And I really suck at it. I mean, I got stumped like three rooms into it. Rooms! So very sad.

This translation looks really good? mostly because all the text is stored as graphics. Still, though? excellent work.

Also, the credits are probably screwed up.
