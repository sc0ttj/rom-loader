When the central computer system of Palma, Mother Brain, exploded 2000 years ago, the planet was destroyed. Other planets under the control of Mother Brain were affected as well, including Motavia, home of Chaz the Hunter. The deterioration of Motavia most notably included the creation of horrendous Bio-Monsters. As Phantasy Star IV begins, Chaz is not aware that it is in his destiny to not only stop these monsters -- but also to save the galaxy.

Though Chaz is the game's main character, he is by no means the only one. Many characters are under your control in the game, up to four at a time in a single party. Your quest involves performing many tasks for people in various Motavian towns (and other planets later), learning more about a much larger quest as you go along. There are several comic book-like cut scenes that evolve the game's story (along with a fair share of plot twists). As the game progresses, the party will encounter countless enemies, helping them to gain experience and thus become more effective warriors. Chaz's specialty is with blades, but the eclectic abilities of the other characters will enable you to use powerful magic and other weapons as well.

Hints:

- Music Test -
Complete the game, and then press B at the ''Start/Continue/Erase'' screen.

- Level 99 Glitch -
If you ever happen to get a character to reach level 99, this odd glitch will occur. Instead of putting a level cap, when you reach level 99 all of your characters will be leveled down to around 40~50. And everytime you should go up a level, your character will go down another level. Although your stats screen will still say you are level 99.
