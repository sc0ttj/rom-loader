Let The Battle Begin.

This is your chance to battle the diabolical Joker for the freedom of Gotham City.

Incredibly strong and armed to the teeth with a vengeance, Batman is prepared to put his life on the line to seek out The Joker and put an end to his evil reign of terror.

But it will not be easy. With the help of the Batmobile, Batwing, and you, Batman will face an army of deadly enemies as he leaps, flies, and dodges their fire on his way to The Joker's hideaway.

Hints:

- Defensive position when being shot -
When Batman is being shot, press Start to pause the game. And then hold the B button and press Start to resume the game. Batman will then be in his defensive position.

- Unlimited Men -
In level 3, at the far-right end of the museum's first level is a 1-Up; go and grab it and then jump onto the rising platforms. When you reach the third platform, or until the screen starts to roll up, jump back down and the 1-Up should be there again.
