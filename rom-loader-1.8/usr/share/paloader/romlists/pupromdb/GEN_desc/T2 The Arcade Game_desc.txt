The #1 arcade shooting game of all time explodes onto Genesis. You're a T-800 terminator with an awesome array of weapons: rapid-fire machine gun, shotgun, rockets and an M-79 grenade launcher. Blast endoskeletons and Hunter Killers... terminate the liquid-metal T-1000 or be terminated!

Gameplay:

Running on the once-popular Williams/Midway Y-Unit arcade hardware, the 2 players essentially take part in controlling a T-800 model and gun down the terminators of the opposing side in a light gun style fashion, even though the controller was technically a joystick. The gameplay utilizes a first-person perspective, like the rest of the games in the genre, but what was noteworthy about T2 was the use of digitized actors from footage specially shot during the making of the film. This made for realistic 2D sprites in a Light gun game for the time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robert Patrick, and Eddie Furlong all reprised their respective roles for the making of the arcade game. Linda Hamilton does not play Sarah Connor in any footage of the game; she is instead played by Debbie Evans.

In the demo sequence, the game has been rated "R" (for Righteous) by the Motion Picture Gaming Association of America.

Hints:

- Level Skip -
When the words 'Press Start' appear on the title screen, press Up, Down, Left and Right twice. You know the cheat will work if Arnie says 'excellent'. To skip the level, pause the game and press B and C together to be taken to the analysis screen.

- Unlimited Firepower -
To get unlimited firepower use a rapid fire controller.
