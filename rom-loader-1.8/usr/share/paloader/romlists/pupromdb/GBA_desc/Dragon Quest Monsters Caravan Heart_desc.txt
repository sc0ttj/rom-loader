You'll travel in a growing Caravan, full of trained guard monsters and a whole bunch of human party members.

Translation Description:

After 2 years of dedicated work, we're proud to present the complete English translation of Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Hearts.

I'd like to thank everyone on the team and everyone who contributed over the years for their support. I'd also like to thank all of the fans who left encouraging comments for us and who believed in this project until the end.

Please read the release notes bundled with the patch. They don't just contain 'boring' technical information but also lots of background information about the game and the translation as well as some notes from our translator.
