For some reason I got some weird glitches at random, but I'm not sure if these were caused due to emulation problems. If you have glitches while seeing the endings, lemme know.

The entire game is translated except for the attract mode. I couldn't edit the Japanese title that scrolls through the screen. Everything else has been translated.
