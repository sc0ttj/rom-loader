Tecmo's first and only hockey game for the Genesis features an NHLPA license for real players with ratings based on the 1993-94 season. Players are rated in speed, agility, stamina, passing, shot accuracy and stick handling, while goalies have additional ratings in defending left and right. The game is played from a horizontal view of the ice as one or two players compete in a Season, All-Star or Preseason game. Options include three levels of difficulty, three game speeds, adjustable period lengths (5, 10, 15 or 20 minutes), line changes (none, automatic or manual), fights and penalties (icing, offsides, interference and personal fouls).

Individual team statistics, standings and season progress are saved to battery, as well as league leaders in total goals, goal percentage, GAA, total assists, save percentage, total points, number of shutouts and PIM. Cinema screens will appear whenever you lay out an opponent with a devastating check or blast a slapshot past the goalie, and you can also review your shots with instant replay. Sports fans take note: Tecmo Super Hockey does not include an NHL license for authentic teams and logos, so clubs are represented by city name only. Unlike Tecmo's other 16-bit sports titles, this game was only released on the Genesis platform.

Gameplay:

Tecmo's take on ice hockey, Tecmo Super Hockey features the license from the NHLPA, having the top players of the game at the time. It offers exhibition and regular games as well as playing a season with updated stats and the ability to play in the All-Star game as well. Gameplay is similar to other games, with buttons to pass, shoot, making slap-shots and fake shots, as well as fighting, which is not a common feature. It can be played by two players simultaneously.
