A mini-sequel to EarthBound, starring Mr. Saturn and Jeff. Short but sweet, Hat Quest is one of the most advanced hacks released to date. It's also the first finalized hack to make liberal use of map editing, advanced event-based changes, and a bevy of other recent discoveries. This game was made with classic puzzle adventure games in mind, so expect a lot of old-school LucasArts-style action.
