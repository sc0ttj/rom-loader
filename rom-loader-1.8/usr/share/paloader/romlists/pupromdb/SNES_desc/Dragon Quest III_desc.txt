Aaaahh, Dragon Quest III. What self-respecting Dragon Quest fan and RPG lover could ever dislike that game? This SNES remake not only ups the graphic and musical quality to better-than-DQVI levels, but all the monster attacks are animated, which looks super sweet! Small Medals were also added, as well as various Pachisi tracks scattered across the globe, and a bonus dungeon that you can access when you beat the game.

All that's fine and good, but I still prefer my Gameboy Color remake of DQIII. You get all that new stuff (except the graphic/musical enhancements.. but since when was DQ about pretty pictures?), plus you can collect Monster Medals which can get you into another bonus dungeon! Pretty tasty!

Translation Description:

Dragon Quest III Reprise, one of the most remarkable Dragon Quests made for the SFC/SNES, is finally being translated. AND NO! This translation is not going to be abandoned. Currently it is in a TESTING PHASE!!! Which means all of the work is done, it's just being revised and fixed! This is as of September 20, 2008.

I look forward to a future release.

DaMarsMan is currently the project leader.
