Zanax EX, a 2D shoot them up game. The follow up of the immense popular shooter Zanac A.I.
Again you are flying fighter space ship built - again - as man's last hope against total annihilation. On board are special weapons to help you blast your way through numerous screens of enemy creatures and destroy the systems home base. Again Zanac EX is divided into areas, which look like planets. The various locations range from deserts to jungles and from oceans to industrial zones. The game has many different types of enemies. Zanac's EX unique artificial intelligence program - just as Zanac A.I. - can intensify the action based upon your level of skill. The better you are, the more powerful "The System". Examples of the A.I. (but not limited to) in this game: the enemies are generally coming randomly with their behavior based on factors like the position your ship in the screen, the place you last died, the shoot speed of the enemies and bosses do also vary. At the end of each area (level) you'll have to fight the area boss. Area bosses are mainly based around huge, screen filling bunker bases consisting of gun turrets and a "core". You also have limited time for fighting against the area boss, a time out could mean failure in entering the next stage, and with the time running, more and more enemies were attacking as penalty.
