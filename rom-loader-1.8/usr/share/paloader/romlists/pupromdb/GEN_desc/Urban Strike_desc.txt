Save the cities of the U.S.A. from Armageddon in ten spectacular multiple-stage missions! Leave your copter and fight on foot. New choppers and ground assault vehicles. New timed sequences, power-ups and interactive control panels.

Directions:

There are ten missions with at least five campaigns each. Urban Strike is a pretty long, and therefore challenging game. You will get to fly two helicopters and you will also get access to a ground assault vehicle. The controls for Urban Strike were better than that of its predecessors. Shooting is easy and what's more is that you can rotate a full 360 degrees.

Gameplay:

Urban Strike is the third in EA's long running series of helicopter action games. An evil genius named H. R. Malone has started a cult and managed to gather millions of followers. Malone is using his influence and wealth to build a super weapon with which he will overthrow the government. You will once again suit up and take control of various types of helicopters to stop Malone's evil scheme.

Urban Strike is the first, and only, game in the Strike series to feature non-vehicular combat. In some levels you will leave your helicopter and proceed on foot.
