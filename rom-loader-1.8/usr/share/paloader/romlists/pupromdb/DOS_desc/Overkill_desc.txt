You arrive at your home planet after a long space flight, only to find it has been destroyed by a demonic warlike alien race that kills for sheer pleasure. You are out for revenge. Your single-minded goal is to destroy the Battle Star. But before you reach him, you will have to battle your way through massive planets packed with danger and destruction. You can gain fuel, new weapons, and new parts for your space ship as you play.

Trivia:

Pressing F9 during gameplay would bring up a 'Boss' screen, which looked like a DOS-mode spreadsheet to make it look like you were doing some work if the boss came in.
