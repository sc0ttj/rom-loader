In King's Quest VI, you play the role of Prince Alexander, as he desperately searches for Princess Cassima of the Land of the Green Isles, who is being held against her will by her captor, Vizier Abdul Alhazred. To successfully help him, he must travel between the Land's four islands and encounter strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. There are many alternate paths you can take, as well as different endings you can watch. Like its predecessor, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface. The CD-ROM version of the game includes both DOS and Windows versions, full speech, a 50-meg introduction, and the Girl in the Tower theme song.

Trivia:

Back cover of the Amiga version contains information: "Beautiful graphics in 256 colours or 32 colours (two versions available)." but the game was released only in 32 colours version.
According to KQ VI reviews in Amiga Computing, Amiga Format and Amiga Power magazines Sierra originally planned to release also 256 colours version but decided that 32 colours version looked so good already so they shelved the idea.

King's Quest VI's villain is named Abdul Alhazred; this name was taken from the work of horror and sci-fi writer H.P. Lovecraft. Abdul was a fictional character (also dubbed ''the Mad Arab'') who wrote the Necronomicon.

 The CD version of King's Quest 6 included "Girl in the Tower" , the theme song to the game, composed by Mark Seibert. A sample of it can be heard on the floppy version for five seconds, then the game urges you to ring up radio stations that was listed in the manual and request it.

- KQ6's introduction was also extended in the CD version.

This was Sierra's first adventure game to feature their lipsyncing technology that they got when they bought out Bright Star Technology.
