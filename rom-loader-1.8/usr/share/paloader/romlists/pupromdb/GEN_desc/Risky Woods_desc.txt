Prepare to risk it all! The ancient monks who preserve the wisdom of the Lost Lands have been frozen in stone. Young Rohan must plunge into the Risky Woods to release them. Only then can wisdom triumph once again! Battle your way through Risky Woods and murky caves. Encounter stomping skeletons and treacherous traps. Overcome terrifying flying fiends as they attack from above. Rescue the monks, but... be prepared for one last battle up ahead!

Gameplay:

Most of Risky Woods involves Rohan running, jumping ledges and fighting monsters while freeing the monks from stone. Most of the bosses are gigantic floating insects encircled by projectiles orbs, who attack Rohan in caves after finishing certain levels. These insect bosses drop treasure chests when defeated, which are filled with hundreds of silver coins for Rohan to collect before moving on.

During the game, a number of other elements present themselves, such as evil monks who were also trapped in stone. Freeing them will cost you and even hurt you; they can be distinguished from regular stone monks by how their stone looks. There are also various valve pieces held by stone gargoyles who you must play a memory game with; match the arrow sequence to destroy them.

The game has no real ending to speak of, and there are no cinematics; Rohan begins his quest in the Woods and ends it in the final castle. There is also a level that takes place in what appears to be Hell.

Hints:
