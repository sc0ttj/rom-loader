When B.O.B. crashes his dad's space car on the way to pick up his date, he finds himself stranded on a hostile asteroid filled with enemies. By collecting power ups and using fast reflexes, B.O.B., tries to find his way off the planet and to his date. B.O.B. fights his way through the forty-five levels, including crazy boss fights and spaceship-racing stages.

The player has available to him a wide variety of weapons and gadgets for use, each with their own ammunition and stock. Use of gadgets, such as a trampoline or helicopter, is necessary to complete some stages. A weaker punch is also available to the player for when ammunition for B.O.B.'s gun runs out or to conserve it. A time limit is supplied for each stage. Once it runs outs, the player's life begins to drop rapidly.
