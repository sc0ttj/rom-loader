The evil Grim Squidge has stolen all of the stars in the Galaxy, and now he's threatening to hurl everyone into the bleak Cosmic Void. Somebody's got to stop him, and that somebody is Tinhead.

Gameplay:

The gameplay is somewhat different than your typical platformer. There is some exploration required to find the exit or if you want to get health or points. You attack your enemies by shooting them with small metal orbs that come out of TinHead's head. You can shoot them in three different directions: diagonal upward, straight, or just let them jump out and bounce over the ground. The direction is chosen by using a specific button.
