Stealth has created a hack that imports Knuckles into Sonic the Hedgehog 1. This is a very advanced hack and includes all of Knuckles moves Spin Dash, Gliding, Wall climbing, and even a bonus feature which can be accessed by imputing the following codes on the title screen.

- Super Knuckles (once all emeralds are obtained): B B B B Up Down Left Right (You'll hear a ring sound if code is implimented correctly)

- Cheat (Start with all emeralds): B B B B B B Up Down Left Right (If implimented correctly you should hear the same sound as when you get an extra continue)
