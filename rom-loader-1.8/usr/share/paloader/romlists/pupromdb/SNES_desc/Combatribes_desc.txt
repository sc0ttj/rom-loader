The SNES version of The Combatribes makes a few changes to the game. The game now has an opening intro which details the plot of the game, as well as dialogue and cut scenes between the main characters and the game's bosses. The gameplay remains the same, with the character's health now represented by a life bar instead of numeric values. There are no weapons to be picked-up and thrown in the SNES version, the stages are simpler and some of the enemy characters are missing. The fifth stage is composed of a boss rush against all the previous gangs before facing the Slaughter Troops. The sixth and final stage is simply a final battle against Martha Splatterhead set atop the rooftop of a high-rise building. She is noted to have unified and taken control of the gangs, rather than the unnamed crime boss in the arcade version who does not appear in this version at all. Additionally, only one Martha will fight the player, regardless of the number of players present at the final stage.

In addition to the main game, there's a one-on-one versus mode similar to the one featured in the NES version of Double Dragon. The player can perform Street Fighter II-style special techniques including fireballs and block attacks with some characters. The game's enemies can also be used by inputting passwords given in the main game.

The North American version of the game was censored, with the blood on enemy's faces during cut scenes being recolored to look like saliva, sweat and tears. One of the bosses, a cyborg general named Swastika, was renamed "Major Blaster", to remove obvious references to Nazism.
