This is a really nifty RPG by Capcom that is precursor to Resident Evil. What makes it interesting is that the game places a greater emphasis on puzzle-solving than fighting, which makes for an interesting change of pace. Actually, you are far more likely to die in the game itself than in a battle. Wandering around is what you'd expect in any Nes RPG - over-head, tile-based movement. You use a variety of items to solve puzzle in this environment, while randomly encountering enemies. The graphics are really nice, too. The overhead graphics almost remind of Quest of the Avatar for some reason, and the battle graphics and portraits look really nice for the Nes. It's a great game.

Translation Description - 
This translation is an accomplishment of well over a year's worth work, which is reflected in the quality of the translation. This isn't a fly-by-night DBZ translation, this is high-quality, kids. You MUST play this game.
