You are a supreme being...with the power to command the forces of nature. Earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, the power to turn the very oceans into fertile plains or the plains into barren rock is yours. But such power is not limitless. Its source is in the number of your followers--the followers of Good--scattered on worlds throughout the universe. These people look to you to level their land so they can raise their crops, build towns and multiply. In return, as their number increases, so does your power to smite the enemy, the followers of Evil.

The forces of darkness threaten to engulf every world in the universe. Your followers will be overrun and you with them, unless you help them prosper and grow, unless you call them to glory, to conquest, to purge the worlds of Evil.

With enough power you can move the Good Papal Magnet. Place it anywhere in the world and your followers will be drawn to it, cultivating the land as they go, or confronting Evil. Make the Good people's Leader into a crusading Knight, and he will invade the enemy, attacking their people, burning towns and crops.

Victory depends on the elimination of Evil. Send your people to hunt them down. Wreak havoc on them with the forces of nature. Wipe them off the face of the world, or if Good outnumbers Evil, call for Armageddon. Every person--Good and Evil--will come together for the final doomsday battle.

From world to world you must go, aiding your followers, destroying the enemy. The landscapes will become increasingly formidable, the power of Evil ever greater.

The Good depend on you to triumph.

Oblivion awaits the loser...

Overview:

The endless struggle between Good and Evil. In Populous, take control as the deity of Good, guiding your people as they confront the forces of Evil across hundreds of different landscapes.

Directions:

It's a classical religious synergy. Use your wisdom to guide, and your control over Nature to help more directly, as you build up your followers to become stronger and more, well... Populous. In turn, you gain more power and influence from the strength and numbers of your followers.

Controls:

A Button - Make selections, Raise Land

X Button - Flatten Land around Settlement
Y Button - Locate Settlements
Start Button - Start and Pause Game
Select Button - Access Command Icons

Hints:

Knights!
A Knight is perhaps your primary weapon against Evil, as he actively seeks them out to destroy them. When you want to attack, you need the strongest Knight possible. Move your Papal Magnet to a position near the enemy land you wish to attack (remember you need a leader to do this). Then set your Influence to Go To Magnet(arrow pointing to Ankh). Use the Question Mark Icon to set the shield on the leader (first one to touch the Magnet if there wasn't one already). Watch the shield until it shows a full yellow bar for your leader, then use the Knight spell. The resulting Knight will be almost impossible to kill. It may take a little while but it's worth the wait. Also remember not to leave your Influence on that setting forever, because your walkers will never settle again.
