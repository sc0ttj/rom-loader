Telebunny is a maze game similar to Pac-Man, Turtles or Ladybug.

Bunny and Turtle are trapped in a maze filled with fruit and dangerous snakes. At the start of the game, all fruits are disguised as hearts. When Bunny passes over a heart, the fruit (lime on the first level, then pears, apples and so on) is revealed. Turtle roams the maze, eating all fruit in his path. On some occasions, the heart turns out to be broken. Broken hearts are deadly to Turtle, but when a snake passes a broken heart, it is turned into a carrot. When Bunny eats a carrot, she turns into an alien and can destroy the snakes. If a broken heart is left alone, it turns into a fearsome mosquito which hunts down Bunny.

The maze is filled with bridges and tunnels so that Bunny can escape the snakes. One of Bunny's abilities is to dig holes in the ground, to reappear in one of the tunnels. After a while, the holes fill with water, where the snakes may be trapped. The thirsty Turtle, on the other hand, just drinks up the water.

Turtle is usually a free-roaming creature, but by holding down the fire button, Bunny can send commands to Turtle in order to guide him to the fruits. For each fruit that he eats, the name of the fruit is spelt out. When it is fully spelt, a door in the top of the maze opens. When Turtle passes through the door, you proceed to the next level.
