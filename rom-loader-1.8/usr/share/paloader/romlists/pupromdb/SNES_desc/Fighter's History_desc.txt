Fighter's History is a 2D fighting game released by Data East. It was first released in arcades in 1993 and a home port followed for the Super NES in 1994. Fighter's History was best known for being responsible for its place in a lawsuit between Capcom and Data East, over what Capcom felt were infringements on their Street Fighter II property. Capcom lost the case on grounds that the copied elements were scenes a faire and thus excluded from copyright.
