Now you have the opportunity to play the same courses that have challenged the world's greatest golfers. World Class Leader Board features four of the toughest championship courses, each with 14 exciting competition formats. And because the look and feel are so life-like, if you haven't caught the golfing bug by now, you soon will! 

Gameplay:

Before the long-running Links series, Access produced the Leader Board lineage, which concludes here. Wind, snap and power are the main considerations as you dodge the bunkers, water and rough which make for more complex courses than the 8-bit versions of the original.

A course editor is provided. The courses provided include real courses like St. Andrews, a fictional designs such as The Gauntlet, which as the name suggests is designed to push your skills to the maximum.

The PC version revolutionized the use of the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via their patented "RealSound" process. Quips like "No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap", "Straight onto the fairway", and "Looks like he hit the tree, Jim." are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.
