Unleash the Beast. Now you command all his power and fury--and you'll need every ounce of it. Because unless each battle is won, you'll remain a hideous Beast forever.

First, protect your castle from hordes of vile beings--sinister creatures, vicious rats, blood-thirsty spiders! The battle rages through the dark, dreary castle. Then it spills out into the icy forest, as you leap from tree to tree, branch to branch. But watch out! Packs of hungry wolves are on the prowl.

Now face the wrath of angry villagers who've pillaged your castle. Regain your stolen valuables with the help of Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts. Then escape to the castle rooftop--only to confront Gaston in hand-to-hand combat!

Summon all the brute strength you can, because you're in for the fight of your life... and it's going to get ugly.
