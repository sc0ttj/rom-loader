It's like Win, Lose or Draw, and just as fun :)

Directions - 
Anticipation is a one to four player game, with the pieces being high heels, a bugle, a teddy bear, and an ice cream cone. Choose the number of players, and computer players. Select your skill level and you start. You'll be on a board. There will be four different colors you can land on - yellow, green, blue, and pink. When you land on a spot, you get taken to a new area. A picture is drawn on this area, and when it is done, you have to spell out the name of the whatever the picture is of (if it is a picture of a rabbit, you spell out rabbit). In the upper right hand corner, a die will slowly move from six to zero. If you don't attempt to answer before it hits zero, you get another card. Otherwise, it will be on a number while you solve the puzzle. Remember this number because...
