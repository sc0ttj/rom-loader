"P.T.O II Is Also Shorthand For "Play This One, Too!""

As another reviewer put it, PTO II is like foreign cheese: not everyone is going to like it, and it does take some getting used to. I tend to agree. He also states that this game is not for those who do not like strategy games. I also tend to agree. PTO II is a very demanding strategy game set in WWII that emphasizes micro-management. If you thought Liberty or Death was confusing, try this! PTO II, while being quite confusing, is also a lot of fun once you know how to play. And with greatly improved graphics and sound this time around, this game blows it predecessor out of the water! Now, the review...

Graphics - 8/10
HUGE improvement over PTO I. PTO I's visuals were, in a word, awful. They reminded too much of the lackluster Uncharted Waters (NOT New Horizons, its sequel, which was much better). Now, these visuals are more gritty. The portraits of your officers are much better-looking, as are the ships, planes, and other military crafts. The map is accurate and colourful, so identifying ports and ships is a breeze. The battle scenes are excellent (especially the plane attacks). Overall, KOEI did a much better job here.

Sound - 7/10
KOEI was never big on music. There are a few pieces here and there, but they are short. But, they are also much better than PTO I's music. I especially loved the Americans mission music and the title screen. The sound effects, on the contrary, are well-done, complete with guns a-blazing and bombs exploding. What KOEI lacks in music in PTO II, they made up for it with sounds. Another good job done here.

Gameplay - 8/10
This department can either be the grace of this game or its downfall. It all depends on how much the player loves slow-paced, demanding strategy, as well as patience. For me however, I love the gameplay. You can play as the US or Japan, and even both! Playing against yourself has never been this fun! Also, you don't have to worry about your land troops anymore (thank goodness!), just the Navy. The monthly conference, with its card system, was quite clever, I might add. A bit frustrating for new players, but fun once you get the hang of it. But, I did dock a few points for seemingly endless amount of menus. KOEI loves menu-based strategy, but they didn't know when to draw the line here!

If you're looking for some fun, albeit frustrating and confusing, strategy games, PTO II should be one of your top choices. It's sleek, it's slick, it's fun, and set in the second World War. What more could you want? Fewer menus, perhaps? That wouldn't have been a bad idea, but nonetheless, this game is enjoyable. Go play it now.
