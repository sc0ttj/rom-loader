This hack allows any of the thirteen teams in the game to be used in VS Match Mode with the proper graphics and statistics. In order to accomplish this, it expands the CHR-ROM portion of the ROM file to create space for the graphics of the team combinations not originally present. It replaces the team select screen from VS Match Mode with the one from Tournament Mode. It also changes the palette used when both players select the same team so that the second team does not use the palette of England. This is done for clarity in case both players elect to play as England.
