Barney the dinosaur began his life on 1987 but never made a worldwide appearance until 1992. A year after his television debut, he made a game - Barney's Hide and Seek.

Directions:

You're a giant purple dinosaur that must find a bunch of hidden children. When you find them, instead of eating them like a normal dinosaur would, you give them a hug, say you love them and send them off to buy their "I survived Jurassic Park" T-shirt.

Controls:
