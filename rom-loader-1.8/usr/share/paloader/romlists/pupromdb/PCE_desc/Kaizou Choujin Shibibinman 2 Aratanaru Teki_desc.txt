If you were to take the first Schbibin Man and write a list of how to improve on it for the sequel, then you would probably come up with the game that is Schbibin Man 2. Developing from the first game, you still get to play as either Tasuke or Kyapiko, but this time the swords are gone. Instead, you have the ability to shoot from a distance and throw a schbibin right from the start - no power up required! There is a continuous storyline that follows the action, although this time round the level order is pre-determined, but there are now underwater shooting levels, upward scrolling levels and gameplay feels a lot faster than the original.

COMMENT:

Graphically, Schbibin Man 2 is a lot better than its predecessor - sprites and backgrounds are cleaner, better shaded and there are some lovely designs in places. But something is wrong - something is missing. On paper, this game sounds like a winner. However, when I come to play it, it seems somehow shallow and unrewarding in a way that is very difficult to pinpoint. Maybe the faster swordless gameplay takes a lot of the skill out as you find yourself just rushing along to complete the levels. Or maybe it's because it's more difficult and less well balanced than the first game. Whatever it is, I was disappointed with this game and consider it the weakest of the three.
