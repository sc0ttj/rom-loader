Blast off on a field trip to the solar system, where every adventure happens on a different planet! Scholastic's THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS game is based on the best-selling book series and hit PBS TV show. Hitch a ride with zany Ms. Frizzle and Liz the Lizard on an ever-expanding space mission... and you're the pilot! Snap photos for your space journal. Learn about satellites, rockets, asteroids, comets and... hey, what's that baseball doing up here? Apply your fascinating discoveries to solving puzzles. Even build your own solar system!
