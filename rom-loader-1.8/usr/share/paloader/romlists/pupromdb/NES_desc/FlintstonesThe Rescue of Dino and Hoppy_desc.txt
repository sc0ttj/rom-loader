THE FLINTSTONES is based on the movie of the same name. You play the role of prehistoric dimwit Fred Flintstone, and along with your wife Wilma and friends Barney and Betty Rubble, you've got a serious problem. The dastardly Cliff Vandercave has kidnapped Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm and it's up to you to find him and rescue the kids.

You'll make your way through 45 levels of wacky FLINTSTONES high jinks battling dinosaurs and driving the Flintmobile in an effort to be the hero. If you think you're up to the challenge, play THE FLINTSTONES, save Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm, and get a taste of prehistoric life while you're at it!
