The game takes place in 2045, when the Tiamatians, intelligent alien beings from planet Tiamat, discover a sort of space-time portal -or "rift", as it is called in the game- that interconnects their homeworld with Earth. Meanwhile, human astronomers discover the same rift, but are not aware of the existence of Tiamat. They also discover that the rift is growing in a geometric rate. As they try to study it, the Tiamatians launch an exploratory probe, named "Torquemada II", in order to find a planet similar to Tiamat; the probe soon finds Earth and sends information back to Tiamat.

As Earth astronomers continue studying the space-time rift in 2047, the Tiamat leadership agrees to send explorers to Earth. It turns out that Tiamatians are planning to conquest Earth to convert it into "Tiamat II". However, Tiamatians have learned that humans have highly developed fighting skills and a vast amount of weapons, and they obviously would not agree to be enslaved. Because the power of the human defense forces, they decide to change their strategy, abandoning a conventional, frontal attack on Earth forces (because they would likely face a high casualty rate and even a defeat) in favor of a plan focusing on a time-traveling technology. This plan consists in sending Tiamatian expeditionary forces to several historic ages, in order to interfere with the development of human weaponry. By doing this, they can secure a victory by truncating the evolution of human weapons, leaving humankind with nothing but weak weapons and at the mercy of Tiamatian forces in the future. 

But their carefully planned strategy has a flaw: it failed to take in count the human intellect.

As Tiamat expeditionary forces are dispatched, a group of scientists led by Dr. Vincent Gilgamesh unveils the prototype of a time-travelling machine. Suddenly, Tiamatians launch an attack on the laboratory where Dr. Gilgamesh works; all but Dr. Gilgamesh are killed. Without having time to test the time-traveling machine, he decides to travel back in time to stop Tiamat's conquest plans. A battle between Dr. Gilgamesh and Tiamatians starts, and it is only a matter of time to decide who shall win.
