Humanity has long since advanced into space, and colonies have been established on many planets, but humanity has yet to contact any alien life. However, an emergency signal has come from the planet Shirakusa. During a colonization survey, contact was lost with the battleship Aphrodite. As a member of the elite Verytex squad, you are sent to investigate.

Verytex is a vertically scrolling space shooter with vague organic themes. There are six stages and three different weapon types: Normal Shot, a standard multidirectional cannon; Beam Laser, a powerful forward-shooting weapon; and Boomerang Laser, a wide-range forward shot. Each weapon type can be upgraded to three increasing levels of power. Also available are homing missiles, which are also upgradeable, as well as smart bombs and shield pickups.

Gameplay:

Verytex was a very straight-forward Shoot em' Up: it had an easy to learn weapon system with three weapons and three power-up levels for each, shield pick-up icons and the option to shift the ship's speed to three levels. Players had to fight seemingly robotic enemies through six long levels and face a boss at the end of each one with the occasional mini-boss between. Verytex was one of many Shoot em' Ups with a checkpoint system involved; it is often criticized for having long, almost 2 minute stretches in levels, fighting the same waves of enemies again with little difference in attack patterns. Often these sections are longer than the rest of the level. They lead up into the boss, and when you lose a life against the boss, you must restart the 2 minute section over again. Verytex also had a limited number of lives for the player to use and a Continue option was available only on the Main Menu.
