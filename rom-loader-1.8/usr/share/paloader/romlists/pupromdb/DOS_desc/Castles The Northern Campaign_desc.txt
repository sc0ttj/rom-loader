The Celts have been defeated and you've built a succession of castles across the wilds of Albion. But still there is no peace. The Picts are rebelling against you in the north and now you must build more castles to defend Albion from these wild savages.

The Northern Campaign is the first campaign disk for Castles, and it includes many new features, such as new graphics, economics, new combat features (vikings, archers etc). and troop training. The Northern Campaign needs the original Castles, it can not be played by itself.
 
Trivia:

Unique for an expansion disk, The Northern Campaign, didn't so much expand Castles, as it literally replaced it! Installing the Northern Campaign replaces the original game, from the conquest of the Celtic lands, to the conquest of the Picts. So if you wanted to play the original Celtic five-castle campaign, you would have to reinstall Castles from scratch. Ouch!
