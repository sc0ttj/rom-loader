This time around, you can select whether or not to include weather conditions, new player animations (high steppin', QB slides), a bigger field and over 100 injuries.

Also includes windowless passing, all new Madden-designed strategies and team match-up that shows how your players stack up to the other team in their position.

This is an official NFL-licensed football game for the Game Gear. It has several features that were pretty new for that time: An announcer comments on the events on the field, the viewpoint changes as you play the game, multiplayer action, and the roster includes 1500 players that were taken from the up-to-date 1994 NFL team roster with all 28 teams. You're not only in control of the quarterback - you can also be the receiver.
