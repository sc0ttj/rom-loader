Last Battle is a side-scrolling beat 'em up released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1989 by Sega. The Japanese version, titled Hokuto no Ken: Shin Seikimatsu Ky?seishu Densetsu, is based on the manga series Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star in English). Since the international version did not retain the Hokuto no Ken license, the graphics and characters' names were altered. It was the second Hokuto no Ken game released by Sega, following the Mark III original (released internationally as Black Belt).

Gameplay:

Due to the game being produced at the beginning of the Mega Drive's life its gameplay is highly simplistic and more akin to 8-bit games of the genre than other Mega Drive examples such as Streets of Rage. The featured levels are flat, two-dimensional and contain very little platform action, with combat restricted to the use of six basic attacks; A kick and a punch which can be performed while standing, crouching or jumping.
The game is known for its difficulty, primarily due to the character's limited offensive abilities, short range, lack of alternative strategies available to the player, highly skilled and far-reaching boss characters and the character's limited health. Also known for the huge 'wall of text' in the intro that's physically impossible to read in one run due to its speed and large phrases.

Trivia:

The Western release is a "tamed" version of the original Japanese game, based on the Fist of the North Star manga/anime series. In the original game enemies died gruesomely as their head exploded, but in the Western version they fly away - think of the Romans in the Ast?rix comics and you get the picture.
