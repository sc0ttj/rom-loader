Head out across the high seas as the legendary Pirate Island, a lush tropical island loaded with buried treasure and buried trouble. You'll explore secret catacombs of unrelenting mind-bending challenge. Discover wealth beyond your wildest dreams. But what is the value of all the riches in the world after you've been snuffed out by the twirling STAR-A-LIZER or the slobbering, bounding JAWS.
