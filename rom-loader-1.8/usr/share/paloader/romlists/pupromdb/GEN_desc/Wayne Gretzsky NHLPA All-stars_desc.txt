Though not revolutionary, this game is enjoyable, especially fighting. You can change your lines at will, show replays to taunt your friends you scored on, or even intimidate to start a fight! This game also has a season mode to run through to win the Stanley Cup. There seems to be no real NHL teams though, I didn't understand that, but it is interesting none the less!

Directions:

Just as in any typical hockey game in real life, get the hockey puck into your opponents' net for a goal. Team with most points after 3 periods is the winner. Watch out for penalties, and no fighting or you'll go to the penalty box!

Gameplay:

Players can play in exhibition mode, regular season mode, playoff mode, and even listen to stereotypical music of each nation in the sound test mode (country music for Canada, rock and roll music for Team USA, for example). In the Sega version, the player's names are formalized (Thomas instead of Tom, David instead of Dave, Steven instead of Steve, etc.).

Players can also have the CPU play some or all of their regular season, but the computer will lose more games than win them so it's important to play as many games as possible manually. In addition to NHL teams, the player can also play as international teams(Sweden, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Russia, United States and Canada).
