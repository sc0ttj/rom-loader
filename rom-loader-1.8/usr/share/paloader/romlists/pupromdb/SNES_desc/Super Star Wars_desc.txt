Ninety-nine lives
There are two sets of floating rocks that must be jumped across in the Sand People level. At the very beginning of the second set of rocks, jump off the edge of the cliff and face to the left. Luke will land on a ledge and enter a small cave area. Ignore the falling rocks and shoot the blaster in the air to reveal several extra lives. Collect them and lose your current life to restart the level at the top of the cliff.  Repeat this procedure to collect up to ninety-nine lives.

Secret Room
In the Inside Sandcrawler level, immediately before the half way location when you cross the drilling spikes, jump forward into a wall instead of jumping to the sliding doors to the lasers. There will be two guns and three or four hearts located there. Besides the ledge with the flamethrower, shoot at the opening side. There will be an extra life.
