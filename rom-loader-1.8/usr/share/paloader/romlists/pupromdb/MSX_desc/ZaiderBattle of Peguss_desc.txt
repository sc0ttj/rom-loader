Ugly graphics and somewhat sluggish gameplay are compensated by nice musics and some ideas still not shown in any other game. You can fly in your ship or go walking on-foot. You must also invade buildings to rescue your squad members and upgrade your weapons. You can also even find someone ready to ressurect your fallen friends.
