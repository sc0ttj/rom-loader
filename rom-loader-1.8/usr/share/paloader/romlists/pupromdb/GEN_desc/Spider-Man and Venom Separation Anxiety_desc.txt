Parting is such sweet sorrow! Venom has been violently split from his living costume, spawning five deadly alien Symbiotes. In fierce two-player action, Venom joins forces with his arch-enemy, Spider-Man, to face the new strain of evil brought to life by chilling, computer-rendered graphics. Between the merciless Jury and awesome allies like Ghost Rider and Daredevil, Venom's out to part his Symbiote offspring from their newfound life!

Directions:

Spiderman and Venom have identical move sets, however, as you can expect Spiderman is fast and weaker while Venom is slower and stronger.

You can use your basic attack to combo enemies. To use a more powerful attack, press jump and attack at the same time.

Using your web power, you can stop them in their tracks, grapple them into a grab, or create a shield to protect yourself. If two enemies are on either side of you, pressing the web button will grapple both of them into each other. The last special ability you have is the web swing. You can swing left or right, or swing straight up. If you are just hanging there you can press the direction you want to go, to swing that way. 

Gameplay:

- Main characters -

    - Spider-Man - The titular hero of the series, Spider-Man is weaker and faster than his teammate, Venom. As in the comic, he is able to punch, kick, swing from webs and cling to walls. In combat, his special moves are oriented toward agility and finesse rather than brute strength.

    - Venom - As a symbiote, Venom is a combination of both human and alien organism. He has all of Spider-Man's generic abilities (web-swinging and wall-crawling), but unlike Spider-Man, his combat moves are primarily based on raw power. He also takes less damage per hit than Spider-Man.

    - The Jury - Unlike the Symbiotes, these level bosses are not superhuman; instead, they are extremely well-armed and well-equipped mercenaries. They appear singly and in pairs at the end of selected levels, and again together at the end of the game. The members are Sentry, Ramshot, Screech, Bomblast, Firearm and Wysper.

    - Symbiotes - Like the Jury, these hybrid alien/human level bosses possess varied combat skills and attack either alone or in pairs until the end of the game. The symbiotes are Riot, Agony, Lasher, Scream and Phage.

    - Carnage- The main antagonist of the game, Carnage appears as the final boss.
