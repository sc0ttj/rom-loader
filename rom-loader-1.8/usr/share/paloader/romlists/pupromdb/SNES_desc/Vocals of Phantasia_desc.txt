FEATURES:

LMB: Linear Motion Battle System

This new battle system allows for the speed and action not present in many turn based RPG battle systems. You control the main charachter, Cless, but you can also give orders to your other characters allowing the computer's sophisticated AI to control them. Both length and height are included, allowing for many levels of attack.

Usually, the Super FamCom's sound hardware would not be able to handle playing full voice samples.

All the attacks and spells are fully voiced, but you can control how much voice you hear from the game. Many talented voice actors and actresses lent their talents for this marvelous game.
