This is an update of acmlm's hack of yesteryear, The Strange Mario Bros. The graphics have been restored to that of the original Super Mario Bros game. This means that they aren't as buggy as those of the original version.

The levels are still the same great ones developed by ACMLM and with the same modifications to the gameplay, this game ought to keep bringing people back for more and more.
