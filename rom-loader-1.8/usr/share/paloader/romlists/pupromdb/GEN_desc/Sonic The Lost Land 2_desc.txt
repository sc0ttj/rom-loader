Sonic: The Lost Land 2 is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis by Shadow Fire. The game is comprised of 11 levels, each filled with dangers you must overcome in order to stop the plans of the maniacal Dr. Eggman. Only palettes, some slight layout changes and various other small modifications have been made for the time being, since this hack is on hold for Sonic - The Lost Land. 

Story

The Lost Land. A beautiful island paradise, once inhabited by creatures known only as the ancients. After managing to overthrow the maniacal Eggman's previous plot, Sonic stumbles across a hidden part of the Lost Land. Unfortunately, Eggman found it first, and has already set up base to work on his next evil plot. With Shadow gone, having left the Lost Land after helping out beforehand, it's only up to the blue hedgehog to save the world from whatever Eggman is planning.

Characters

Sonic - The Lost Land 2 only allows for one playable character, with the evil Dr Eggman as the antagonist. Although by using savestates, you can add Tails to the game.

Sonic the Hedgehog

Sonic is a blue, 15-year-old hedgehog who lives on the planet Earth. He has the ability to run at supersonic speeds, hence his name. He is always running all over the world, rarely stopping for anything. He is carefree and relaxed; however, he is also very intolerant of injustice, and he will do anything he can to help those in need. He has also got a quick wit, short temper, and a fairly large ego.

Dr Ivo Robotnik (EGGMAN)

With an IQ of 300, and self-proclaimed the greatest scientific genius in the world, Eggman stops at nothing in his attempts at world conquest. While his plans are constantly foiled by Sonic, this only makes him more determined to conquer the world. Will he succeed?
