Ork tells the story of a young alien military cadet Ku-Kabul, who is beamed town to the surface of Ixion - the planet of trials. Once on the surface, he must complete 5 survival boot camps and become the Legion-Command Officer or die trying.

A sidescrolling action-adventure developed by WJS Design and published by Psygnosis (Shadow of the Beast, Leander), Ork features five expansive levels characteristic of Psygnosis games of the era. While slightly similar to the same firm's earlier Killing Game Show, Ork's presentation is more polished, and the gameplay is less hectic. 

In addition to blasting enemies, the player must complete tasks reminiscent of adventure games. Examples including locating and delivering a payment to a gate keeper, finding a specific key to open a door, or locating an orb to deflect lasers.
