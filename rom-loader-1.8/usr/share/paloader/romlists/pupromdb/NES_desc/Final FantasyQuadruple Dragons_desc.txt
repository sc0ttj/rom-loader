Kabucho informed us a week ago that he released a hack of Final Fantasy, called Quadruple Dragons. Quadruple Dragons is about four warriors that set out to revive the Four Orbs of the elements. You can choose from a Soldier, who is very strong in melee attacks, but is as dumb as a brick. The Bandit, who is very quick and is an average fighter. The Monk is very strong if you know how to use him. The Mage masters the art of black magic, while the Priest studies white magic. The Comic is useless... unless you get his character class up. In this game, all of the text, armor, weapons, magic, almost everything is changed from the original Final Fantasy. Even some of the towns and overworld map is changed.

WARNING - I got froze after saving the Princess in the beginning.  I don't know if this hack is beatable past that point.  ~Rx
