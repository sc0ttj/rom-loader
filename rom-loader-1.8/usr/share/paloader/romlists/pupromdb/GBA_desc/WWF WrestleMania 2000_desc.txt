WWF Wrestlemania 2000 is THQ's first WWF licenced game after making two previous WCW titles. Wrestlemania 2K picks up where WCW/NWO Revenge left off. The graphics are by far superior as well is the animation. Wrestlemania 2K adds three highly sort after features: Cage match, custom entrances and Create A Wrestler feature.

Wrestlemania 2K features more than 50 real WWF stars as well as the option for 16 custom wrestlers. All the wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide shows) and entrance performances. A great improvement over the previous game is the "road to Wrestlemania" mode, an enhanced tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be challenged by other wrestlers in a 12 month journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.

A combination of the classic Marvel comics characters and the recent movie release, X-Men. All the characters are here, each with their normal moves (much like Street Fighter in terms of the buttons pressed on the control pad), and plenty of super moves to spice things up.

There are plenty of bonus things to find on the CD, ranging from movie clips of your fighter after you complete the game with him/her, new costumes (each fighter starts with costumes from the comics. The new ones, when unlocked, are much like the ones in the movie) and a movie story if you complete the game with all of the fighters.

Also included is a movie trailer for X-Men the movie, and comic art by Marvel boys Joe Maduera, Adam and Andy Kubert and more.
