Using the mouse to determine the direction and strength of your putts, you must navigate 9 tricky holes of crazy / mini golf. Try to putt into holes protected by bouncing hamburgers, windmills, etc.  Courses have several twists; one is a mad scientists's lab, another is a pinball table.  The final hole is especially bizarre, themed around energy.

You start with 3 strokes, but get the par for each hole added on, if you reach it in time -  run out of strokes, and your game is over. You can earn bonus strokes by finding hidden bonuses and by completing courses quickly.  Up to 4 players at a time can take part in this game, with anyone badly over par being eliminated as the game progresses.
