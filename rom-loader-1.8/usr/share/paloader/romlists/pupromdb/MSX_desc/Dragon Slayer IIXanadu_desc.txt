The second game in Nihon Falcom's Dragon Slayer series is, like its predecessor, a dungeon-crawling RPG with action combat. You are a nameless apprentice fighter who must venture into the depths of a cave system beneath the town and become stronger by fighting the creatures that lurk there. When you come into contact with an enemy, you enter a separate battle screen with multiple enemies. You attack enemies by simply bumping into them. You'll take damage if the enemy attempts to attack you from the sides or from behind, but if you are stronger than the enemy, you'll damage it by frontal attack. Killing enemies gives you experience points and treasure. In the town, you can train separately either one of your main parameters (strength, dexterity, charisma, etc.), spending your experience the way you like.
