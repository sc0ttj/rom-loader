Typhoon Thompson in Search for the Sea Child is a 1989 computer game created by Dan Gorlin. It was published by Br?derbund for the Atari ST and Amiga.

Typhoon Thompson is a remake of the Apple II game from Br?derbund called Airheart, also written by Gorlin. Airheart is a particularly notable title for the platform as it is the best example of the rarely used 16-color "Double High Res" graphics mode available in the enhanced Apple IIe and Apple //c (and, later, Apple IIgs) in an arcade-style game. The backstory presented to the user as well as the in-game mechanics are almost identical between the two titles. While Typhoon Thompson is controlled with the mouse, Airheart is controlled with the analog joystick.

Typhoon Thompson was an unusual game where you had to fly round an ocean and shoot at various unusual beasts.

The plot was that the "Sea Child" was stolen and Typhoon Thompson sent in to rescue it, with the guidance of a few strange, cowled ghost-types (who would occasionally be nasty to poor old TT).

The game never played like a "shoot-'em-up" - too much persistant firing was never much use - and required more tactics.

On the later levels, shoot lots of islands at a time. Blast the baddies and there'll be so many sprites in the water that you won't be able to fail to pickup a load.
