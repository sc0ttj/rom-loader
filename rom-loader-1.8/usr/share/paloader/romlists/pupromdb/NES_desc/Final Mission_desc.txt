In a humorous take on the eighties' sci-fi judgment day films, you either play Arnold or Sigourney in a mission to save the world. The year is 2029 and an alien invasion, led by Supreme Commander Vile Malmort, threatens the earth.

The heroes are equipped with a jet pack and two orbiting cannons. These can be set to fire in one direction or in a fixed pattern. You can fly in all directions and use power-ups to gain new types of weapons or to restore health. Only seven lives per mission are provided, but there is an unlimited amount of continues.

Note from Rx - This is the Japanese version of "S.C.A.T. - Special Cybernetic Attack Team" in the US, but the gameplay is different so it's included in the Xtras.
