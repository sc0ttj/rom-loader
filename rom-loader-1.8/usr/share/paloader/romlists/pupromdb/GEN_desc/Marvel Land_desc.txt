In 1989, Namco released an arcade game called Marvel Land. The game featured beautiful graphics and platforming elements while you take the role of a dragon man, as he sets out on a journey to save the amusement park Marvel Land. Since arcade games were designed to eat as many of your coins as possible, Marvel Land has very high difficulty and longetivity, so it's unlikely someone will finish this game in one sitting (especially when in an arcade).

Trivia:

The European port was re-titled Talmit's Adventure.
