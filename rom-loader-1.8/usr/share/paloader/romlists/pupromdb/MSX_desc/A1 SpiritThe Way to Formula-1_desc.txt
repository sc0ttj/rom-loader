This third-person racing game featuring Formula 1 cars and circuits. Besides F1 you can also choose to race a stock car, drive a rally, an endurance race or race F3 or F3000. There is a two player mode. The difficulty level can be set, and the number of laps is variable and you can select the track you want to race. The field includes ready made and custom made cars (you can select engine, tires, suspension). Avoiding the slower cars you come up to lap can be crucial.
