Well, you can tell from the screenshots below that it's not that complicated of a game, but it's still helluva fun to play. You play as two characters, Popolon and Aphrodite. I assume that the two of them have different skills or something cool like that, but I can't figure it out. I think Aphrodite can like, smash those weird-looking blocks or something cool like that. Anyway, it's just a fun game where you get stuck a whole lot, which, you know, makes sense, since it's a maze and all. So in short, fun game.

Translation Description - 
Everything's translated except the title screen, but no one cares about stuff like that. You already know what the game is called, right? The only weird thing is that due to space constraints, Popolon and Aphrodite are now Poplon and Venus. Get over it.
