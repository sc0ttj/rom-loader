Binary Asylum's final release puts you in control of a helicopter, and sets you 32 missions to complete. The level structures involve different military objectives, of protecting or destroying a particular area. The surprise is in the graphics - patchwork-quilt style landscapes and a remote view, reminiscent of Virus. The game offers joystick and mouse control options, as well as sections in which you must direct ships and planes. A range of weapons are offered, with resupply ships on the water to dock with.
