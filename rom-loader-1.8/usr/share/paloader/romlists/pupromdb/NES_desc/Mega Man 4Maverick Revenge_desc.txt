This is the first time I have tried to edit a game, and with zero programming skills it wasn't easy. But with some help from MegaFLE X and Matrix I was able to anyway. There are some KNOWN bugs in this hack, but like I said, because of limited knowledge of ASM I wasn't able to fix everything.

Don't get confused by the name, it doesn't have anything to do with the Mavericks. There is no story line in this game, no intro or anything. It's just a game!

The bosses and enemies are generally the same, but the levels have been completely changed, as have some of the graphics

Happy gaming! :)
