Greendog is a cool California surfer that wipes out after hitting a "huge wave", and wakes up with a cursed pendant around his neck. However, the pendant will not come off; it dooms the wearer to be attacked by animals and prohibits surfing. The only way that Greendog can lift the curse is to travel to lost Aztec civilization and track down six pieces of a lost treasure.

The single-player gameplay requires you to survive several side-scrolling levels, armed with only a flying disc that you can shoot at enemies to destroy them or at various objects in order to gain more energy.

The game has some homages to earlier side-scrolling adventure games, such as Pitfall as the character often has to swing on vines to advance and many of the levels take place in a tropical jungle or in an ancient temple. Many levels require the player to use a skateboard or inline skates to advance.

The Ancient Temple levels consist of either platforming your way to a randomly-generated tiki-like boss, each piece that has a special power, or skateboardin' or rollerbladin' your way through an obstacle course. Each piece of the Aztec treasure you collect gets you closer to your goal. Collcting them all reveals that they're actually pieces of an ancient surfboard, thus breaking the curse!

Gameplay:

The gameplay involves you getting from the left end of the level to the right while fighting off wild animals with your trusty Frisbee and using your athletic skills to jump over platforms.
