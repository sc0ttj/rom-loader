The tradition continues. The intensity. The passion. All the things that made John Madden Football the best-selling football video game: On-screen playcalling, IsoVision passing camera, audibles, player ratings. Spin. Dive. Jump. Hurdle. Cut back. Break tackles. You control the action! And now Madden '92 brings you even tougher opponents. Get away with your big play once, but go back to it too soon and you'll get stuffed - Big Time!
