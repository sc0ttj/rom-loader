So you think the unlicensed Tetris game for the NES is hard to find? Just try to get your hands on the Japanese Megadrive Tetris. It was developed alongside Sega's System-16 arcade version, but never reached shelves after legal wranglings gave Nintendo exclusive console rights. However, that little issue doesn't stop some people from obtaining it. Apparently, there are about 10 copies known to be floating around.

An adaptation of Tetris for the Sega Genesis, featuring 3d-rendered graphics and support for two languages (English and Brazilian Portuguese). It is almost complete; all that is left to do is to implement the battle mode.
