In the black of night he stalks his unwitting victims with the passion of a prince and the grace of a wild animal. Able to assume the guise of everything from a shadow on the wall to a jagged-toothed wolf beast, he feed on the living. Sinking his pearly fangs into their fair throats for a drink of their life-giving blood.

For he is the Prince of Darkness--Count Dracula--and he's cast his hypnotic spell on your lovely mistress, Mina Murray. Now you, Jonathan Harker, must drive a stake through the heart of this vampire and save the fair Mina from a fate worse than death--eternal life as a vampiress.

--From the Genesis Bram Stoker's Dracula instruction manual.
