This is the "Core Hack" meaning it's not the whole game. What it is though is a large series of modifications I made to the game with help from other contributors which I'll list in the credits below.

This hack contains:

- New Title Screen

- New Characters

- New Spells

- New Lores (Replaced to "Weave")

- New Dialog/Menu Font

- New Item Icons

- New Items

- New Content

- Hold "B" to run.

- Vicks/Wedge start with all Magitech skills.

- "Annihilated" changed to Owned.

- Psycho Cyan fix.

- "Summon" ability now works.

- "Sword Tech" is now sped up.

- Names are now lower case.

You may be wondering what "Weave" is, well when you combine two elements, it makes a new spell. This is what I call a "Spell Weave", original or not I liked the idea and implemented it.

This hack was mainly made for rom hackers who hack bosses or for any other use which pertains to rom hacking.
