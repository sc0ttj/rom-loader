Ostensibly based on the 1984 movie, The Last Starfighter is... More actually a port of the 1985 Commodore 64 game Uridium. Apart from the title screen, soundtrack and the abbreviated names of characters on the high score list, it has no real connection to the movie. The C64 version is well regarded, but this port is bland and lifeless, with simplistic graphics and a hard-to-navigate ship. Running into obstacles is all too common, as the flat, top-down perspective makes it difficult to determine the height and placement of objects.
