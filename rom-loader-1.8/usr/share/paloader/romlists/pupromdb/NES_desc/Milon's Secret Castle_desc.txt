Overview - 
You play as the young tone deaf apprentice named Milon, a wizard. The apprentice has the power to shoot bubbles to kill enemies and other things, too! Now, Milon must find his master in a very large, secret castle by solving puzzles! Can you do it?!

Directions - 
You have to kill the baddies by shooting bubbles at them. Use the control pad to control the bubbles! The bubbles can also be used to shoot the blocks to sometimes reveal money, amongst other things. If you get low on energy, use hearts to recover one bar. If you really want to win, you have to collect money to buy stuff at shops. Collect honeycombs to give Milon one bar of energy! While holding medicine, if you touch a boxing glove, you can shrink down to half your normal size. But the real thing you have to worry about is how to get the keys! The keys can unlock doors to certain levels.
