Raw is one of the most successful TV wrestling programs in the world today. Those athletes go out and give it their all to entertain millions. In the old days, RAW had many greats like Bret Hart, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Owen Hart, Diesel and Bam Bam Bigelow! In this game, you play as them to win!

Directions:

There are many ways to have fun with this game. There's the occasional one-on-one match, where two wrestlers go at it. There's also tag team matches, where two teams of 2 fight against each other. There's a Survivor Series, where two teams of 4 fight and if one member is defeated, he is eliminated. If they all are eliminated on a team, the remaining team wins! Royal Rumble is where wrestlers come in randomly and your job is to get them out of the ring before they do it to you. In the Bedlam match, all 4 tag team competitors are in the ring together and they do not need to be tagged in. Lastly, the Raw Endurance Match, where two teams of 6 will compete. Each team will send out one wrestler at a time to combat a wrestler from the other team. The last team that still has a member who hasn't been pinned wins the match-up.

For one-on-one, tag team, and Bedlam matches, you have sub-options! There's a one fall match, where the first person to pin their opponent wins. There's a brawl, where you can fight anywhere around ringside, and anything goes! And there's the Tournament, where you fight in a series of matches for the WWF Championships!

The list of wrestlers are: Bret Hart, Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, Razor Ramon, Lex Luger, Doink, Shawn Michaels, 1-2-3 Kid, Diesel, Owen Hart, and Luna Vachon.
