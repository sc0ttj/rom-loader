Top Players' Tennis gives you total command of the ball. Hit a passing shot cross court or deown the line; play deep from the baseline; serve and volley; play a perfect drop shot; or take the game with an overhead smash. You set the speed of the serve and the spon on the ball, giving it a top spin, slice, drop shot or side spin just like the pros.
