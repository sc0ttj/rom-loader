In Menzorberranzan the player takes the role of two adventurers (two more can be recruited) who have just returned from a fight against an evil enemy in the Icewind Dale. A drow raid looking for Drizzt attacks the village the adventurers are staying in and takes several villagers as hostages. Now (probably with the help of the captain of the guard) the adventurers will have to rescue the villagers in an epic that spans to the evil city Menzorberranzan itself.

Menzorberranzan is a treat for any fan of the Drizzt books by R.A. Salvatore, as Drizzt and Guenhwyvar can join the party during the quest.
