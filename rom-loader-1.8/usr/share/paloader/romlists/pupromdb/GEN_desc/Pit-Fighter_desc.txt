Pit-Fighter is a no-rules, unregulated fighting game which lets you control one of three digitized fighters: Buzz, a body builder and former pro wrestler; Ty, a kick-boxing Pit-Fighter veteran; and Kato, a speedy, very agile Karate expert. Each character has three super moves. In addition to fighting with fists and feet, weapons such as sticks, knives, crates, and garbage cans are available throughout the game. As you progress through the levels, you'll eventually face ten different fighters, each of them with unique abilities and fighting techniques. The fights take place in seven different areas: a warehouse, a garage, a subway station, a high-rise building, a bar, a freeway overpass, and a wharf. Like most fighting games, the one-player game is a series of one-on-one fights. The two-player simultaneous mode, however, differs from the norm in that instead of fighting each other, you and your gaming partner fight two of the bad guys. As the fights play out, a crowd of anxious spectators cheer. If you get too close to the audience, you get shoved back into the middle of the action.
