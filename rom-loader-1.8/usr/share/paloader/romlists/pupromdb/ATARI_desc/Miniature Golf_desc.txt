Miniature Golf is a Golf game, published by Atari, which was cancelled before it was released.

Although it doesn't stand out graphically, this game is a complete 18 hole miniature golf course. It's actually not that bad considering how difficult it would be to program any sort of 3-D version.
 
Use SELECT, OPTION and keys 1-9 on computer version.
