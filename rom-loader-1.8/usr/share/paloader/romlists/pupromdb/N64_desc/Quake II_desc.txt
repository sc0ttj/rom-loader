Authentic Nintendo 64 effects and newer, fiercer levels pack stunning graphic detail into an already vicious version of Quake II! Featuring Two-, Three-, and Four-player Deathmatch, fully customizable controls and save game features, this masterpiece takes gaming to an undefined level! Eerie environments of light and shadow loom within newly designed, mission-based levels not found in the PC version.

The Nintendo 64 version, unlike the PlayStation version, had completely different levels, music and multiplayer maps. Like the PlayStation version it too featured multiplayer of up to 4 players. This version also had new lighting effects, mostly seen in gunfire, and also used the Expansion Pak for extra graphical detail.
