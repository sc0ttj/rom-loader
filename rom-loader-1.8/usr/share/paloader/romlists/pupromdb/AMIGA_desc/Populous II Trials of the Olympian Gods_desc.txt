You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.

CHEATS: 
	
Level 999: Type killuspal at the title screen.

Hidden monsters: 
Place the maximum of 200 people on the landscape to
force one of the three hidden monsters to appear. 

Easy victory:
Load a conquest game as usual, then click on the game
setup icon. Select "Custom Game" and enter the game
options and set them as desired. Click on "Evil", then
"Two Players", and then cancel your selection. Your
opponent will now be unable to alter the landscape and progress
in the game.
Populous II continues the "god game" genre pioneered by Bullfrog's classic Populous.  In PII, you're an unproven immortal who must fight your way through an entire pantheon of Greek gods, each with his or her own strategy and attacks, and ultimately enter into a showdown with Zeus himself.

The gameplay mechanics are similar to Populous, but PII features a wider array of spells, digitized sound, and high-resolution graphics to give the spell effects extra punch.  Multiplayer is supported via serial link and dial-up.

CHEATS:

When the "Choose your Deity" screen appears, enter "ADKIUCMCZNDIFINL" to start the game with maximum power gor in all areas of godly control. Note Amiga Action gives the password as "ADKITAKDVGZLRGWZ". It might also be "ADKIUCKBZNZEFIWX", or "ADKITDMEVQDPXWTN".

To activate lightning, hold down the Left Mouse Button, Press '1' on the keyboard, and release the Mouse Button. Now the lightning remains and your manna won't decrease. Amazing!

If you can use "TREES" in the vegetation section and you have either the "RAIN of FIRE" or the "COLUMN of FIRE" in the fire section, then combining "TREES" and either "FIRE" will enable you to destroy enemy masses. Simply place trees all over the enemy territory, close enough to one another that the burning of one will cause another to ignite and it another, and so on.

Choose the Conquest game you're stuck on and locate the first of the enemies' houses. Note its location on the big map. Quit back to the main menu and chose a Conquest game you have completed and in which you had the rain of fire spell. Go to the location in the game where you noted the house in the game you're stuck in. Cast the rain of fire spell and when it appears, quit back to the main menu again. Again choose the Conquest game you're stuck on, and if you've positioned the rain of fire properly in the prior game, the enemy will be killed.

You may also try "MUSIC" as a special code for different music, and clicking on the writing that encircles the game area for some special effects.
