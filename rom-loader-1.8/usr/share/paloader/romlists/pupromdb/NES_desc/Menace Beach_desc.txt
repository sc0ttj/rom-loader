Your sassy but lovable girlfriend has stood you up again. Or has she? Bunny was all set for this afternoon's rendezvous at the malt shop, when she was mysteriously abducted by Demon Dan. Armed only with street-smart reflexes and a fair amount of youthful wit, you set out on your souped-up skateboard. You will confront an impossible number of challenging enemies such as disgruntled dock workers, evil clowns, schools of piranhas, nasty ninja and sumo. To turn the odds in your favor, you must make use of bombs, bottles, balloons, frogs, and fire hydrants. Finally you will find Demon Dan in his dark and dreary underground caverns. You must defeat him to save Bunny from his evil clutches!
