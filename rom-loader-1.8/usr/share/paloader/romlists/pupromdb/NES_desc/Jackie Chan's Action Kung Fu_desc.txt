The player controls Jackie Chan, the famous martial arts stuntmaster, and brawls against many nameless goons during his quest to rescue his sister. There are five levels in the game, each with a boss at the end.

Along the way, Jackie can encounter frogs carrying power-ups or bowls that restore health, which he can obtain by hitting the frog. These power-ups can allow him to do a special type of attack a certain number of times. Only one power-up may be carried. Jackie can also charge a special beam-like attack on his elbow by holding the B button and releasing it. This attack may be done five times. Most enemies Jackie defeats will drop green orbs. Collecting 30 of these orbs will replenish his life and his 5 charged shots.

If the player dies, all orbs and power-ups are lost and must be gained again. The player only has 1 life in the game, but may continue up to five times initially. Extra continues may be earned through the bonus stages.

Bonus Stages - 
Occasionally, a bell may appear in certain areas of the levels, which will take Jackie to a bonus stage. The bell appears when the player stands at a certain place on a platform. These stages involve doing some task such as jumping on clouds or hitting fish dropping from a waterfall. The better Jackie does, the more points he earns and the better his rewards.
