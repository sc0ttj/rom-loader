Disney Interactive really outdid themselves with this much loved classic game, and really helped the NES go out with a positive shine once this game was added to it's library.

Story - 
Exactly like the movie. You play as Simba, a young lion prince who is destined to become king of the Pridelands. However, Simba's father is brutally murdered by his evil uncle, whom forces Simba into exile. It's up to you to help the cub grow into a king and regain his throne (okay, so it sounds kind of corny, but it does follow the movie to a tee).

Graphics - 
The graphics are pretty much your standard NES type, but it often appears in some levels that the objects are more textured and detailed than you would expect. Most of the characters and scenery in the game are very small compared to what's in the game on other systems--but remember, this IS the NES, it doesn't exactly have the capacity for more detail. Some of the characters are very hard to distinguish and the concentration it takes to figure out what's what can distract you away from the game itself from time to time. This really isn't a huge flaw since there aren't many enemies on the screen at one time, but it can be a little frustrating. Despite it's flaws, it seems the NES is really pushed to its utmost limits with this game.

Gameplay - 
Almost perfect. You perform the same moves in this game as you do in the SNES, Genesis, etc. versions (and the layout of the game is almost the same too). You can jump, snarl, and pounce on enemies. Once Simba is older, you can roar, slash, and maul your enemies among other moves. The downside to this section is that the movement can lag a little on occasions, causing the controls to become sluggish. It is understandable for this game to have a bit of slowdown, although it doesn't happen very often. The controls are a dream too, every action is easy to maneuver and they really allow you to feel like you're in total control (which is, of course, a good thing).
