Wings II:Aces High is a very entertaining game. It's a lot like Pilotwings except it has a WWI theme. There are a ton of missions to complete, and several pilots to choose from. As you go through the game, your pilots get better. If you get one of them killed, however, he will remain dead for the rest of the game. The game is over when you have no pilots left. There are basically two kinds of missions: dogfight, and bomber. Sometimes, it is a combination of both. By the end, you get to go up against the bloody Red Baron. Wings II: Aces High is a great challenge, so good luck!
