GO GO POWER RANGERS! Based on the hit 90's live action show, an evil sorceress by the name of Rita Repulsa has come to conquer Earth. A wise wizard, Zordon, and his faithful robot assistant Alpha 5, knew that they would have to give the legendary power to five young people... teenagers with attitude. Only Jason the Red Ranger, Billy the Blue Ranger, Zack the Black Ranger, Kimberly the Pink Ranger, and Trini the Yellow Ranger can stop Rita and thwart her evil plans once and for all.

I fondly remember the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, and playing this game helps to relive those childhood memories. Just the opening screen, when you see the logo and hear the theme blaring, you know you're in for something good. Each of the heroes is well detailed in the game, each with their own style of combo hits, weapons, and appearances when unmorphed. Each ranger looks figuratively the same in their suits which may draw some frowns, though, even if it isn't that big of a deal. Every stage in the game, from Downtown California to the Sewers, sets the mood with choices of color and types of enemies you encounter. The sound is done well, the theme song at the beginning is pretty clear for an SNES game, lyrics and all, and the music in each stage really adds that extra boost of excitement while you play. If you're an old fan, this game is right up your alley. If you're just an average gamer who isn't quite familiar with the show, give it a try and see how you like it.

Directions:

You can choose from 5 different characters: Jason, Billy, Zach, Kimberly, and Trini. Now, while each one has different ways to fight, the way they are executed are all the same. Pressing the punch button repeatedly does a combo that's useful against the stronger baddies you take on.

Usually one combo of attacks can destroy a purple Putty, even if the combo involves more striking than others.

It'll start simply enough: the weaker Putties, the foot-soldiers of Rita, will come, and taking them out is easy enough. Then it gets to stronger Putties, to spiders, and more.

You start off in a civilian form, but when you come to a place in the level where you encounter a boss for the first time, you morph into your character's respective Ranger form. You also earn refilled health when you do this, which can be a big help. Even so, items such as health kits and food are scattered about and help in the same way. Each Power Ranger also has their own personal weapon, such as Red with the Power Sword and Pink with her Power Bow. In case you feel overwhelmed by enemies, you can break out a special power up. This unleashes a bomb type of attack which will eliminate the lesser enemies and deal serious damage to a boss. Don't worry about it being gone forever; if you use your special attack early on, you might come across a canister that holds another. When you get to said boss at the end of each stage, be ready and find out their style so you'll be able to outsmart their fighting patterns.
