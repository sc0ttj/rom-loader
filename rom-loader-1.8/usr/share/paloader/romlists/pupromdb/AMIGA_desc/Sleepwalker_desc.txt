CTA's original IP stars a toon dog called Ralph who must stop his sleepwalking master Lee from waking up. Ralph must bridge gaps, beat up baddies, stop Lee falling into water, inflate his own body and float above obstacles, and generally be a selfless version of man's best friend.

Between each of the major levels, there is a dream sequence where Ralph can collect various tokens and trigger what he "really" thinks should happen to Lee.

The are six huge parallax scrolling main levels and five bonus levels. There are several full motion video sequences setting the story.

There is also a special Amiga 1200 version which has enhanced full motion video and in game graphics.
