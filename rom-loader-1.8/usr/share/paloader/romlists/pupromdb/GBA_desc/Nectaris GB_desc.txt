This game is actually pretty fun. I usually don't like strategy games, but this one moves fairly fast and isn't overly complicated. And it actually has something of a plot, involving some kinda war on the Moon. This game has been ported to a number consoles and computer platforms, and actually has a bit of a following.

As usual, blibber did a very thorough job, and did a great job making the script cohesive. An excellent job done on a pretty good game. Go try it out for yourself.
