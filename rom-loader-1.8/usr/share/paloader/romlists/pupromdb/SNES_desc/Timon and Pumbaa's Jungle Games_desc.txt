Timon & Pumbaa's Jungle Games includes Jungle Pinball (self explanitory), Burper (a shooter type game, using pumbaa to belch gas), Hippo Hop (a platformer), Bug drop (similar to tetris) and Slingshooter (a shooting with a slingshot game) accessible directly from the menu. The object in this game is to have fun while Timon and Pumbaa from The Lion King entertain the player with glimpses of jungle living, especially when certain mini-games require the player to consume insects. The PC version featured a full voiceover, complete with humorous introductions to games. The SNES version does not feature the voiceover, but has some sound effects from the PC version intact. The PC version also has a new game called Bug Drop, a Puyo Pop styled game.
