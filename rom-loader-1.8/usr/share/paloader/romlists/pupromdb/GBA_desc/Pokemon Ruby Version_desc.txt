Pok?mon is back for another round catching and training! You're the new guy (or girl) in Littleroot Town, and the newest generation of Pok?mon trainers. Professor Birch sends you on your way in your journey, with one of your choice of 3 starter Pok?mon. There's Treecko (A grass-type chameleon-like little guy) Torchic (a Fire-type bird) and Mudkip (a Water-type amphibious creature).

Now, you've got a whole new world to explore in Hoenn, with eight new gyms and two-on-two battles, opening up a whole new myriad of tactics! New items, new Pok?mon (over 350!!), and a new Pok?dex to boot too! And of course we have our new villains, the nefarious Team Magma, who plan on submerging the world in water in order to call out the Legendary Groudon!

Only one person can stop them and become the ultimate Pok?mon Master... You!
