This is Nancy at Chase Headquarters. We've got an emergency here! Always wanted to drive a Porsche 928 but couldn't afford one? Well here's your chance...as lucky cop Tony Gibson you take part in high speed pursuits to capture dangerous criminals.

You have a set time to reach the perps before they escape, and then resort to the age-old tactic of smashing into them as hard as you can to finally ram them off the road. But look out as there are forks in the road and a wrong turn can set you back for good. Once the offending crim is taken in for questioning (or a severe beating most likely), you radio in for your next mission.

HINTS:

- Level skip -
Press Right, I, Left, II, Up, Select, Down, Select at the title screen. In the game, hold up/right, and press I + II + Select

- Sound test -
Press Left, Right, I, II, Down, Select, Up, Select at the title screen.
