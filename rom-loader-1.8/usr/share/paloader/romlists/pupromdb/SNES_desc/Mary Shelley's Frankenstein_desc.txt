Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a video game for multiple platforms that is based on the 1994 movie of the same name. The player controls Frankenstein's monster as he stomps through the streets of Ingolstadt, Bavaria (now Ingolstadt, Germany) in the year 1793 seeking revenge against a certain man named Victor for rejecting him once he was created. Since he is a product of artificial manufacturing (instead of natural childbirth through a human mother), he is condemned and declared an expendable pariah by the mostly illiterate peasants and soldiers. The common folks that strive to kill Frankenstein's monster are highly ignorant about modern science and believe that he is truly a demon. The player gets to use a wooden stick at enemies that do not accept him for who he is.

The stick that Frankenstein's monster carries can be put on fire if swung towards fire. Frankenstein also has an additional attack; a blue ball of negative energy that pops up when the player releases the button. Peasants in the game can either be male or female; soldiers are always male. The female peasants attack with pots while the male peasants attack with melee weapons. However, the soldiers (men dressed in red) attack the player with musket shots. Simple puzzles involving switches and pulleys must be solved in order to progress within the levels.
