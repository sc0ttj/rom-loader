After eons of fighting between the genders, men and women have broken into separate factions, each using genetic engineering to create new followers, and waging terrible war upon each other.

Upon selecting the side you wish to play (depicted as either clueless blondes who can't drive, or beer-swigging lazy oafs), you select a team of 4 for your missions, arm them up with guns and other assorted weaponry, and wreak havoc on the 'enemy' in this isometric Syndicate-like game.

Progress through the levels to the final conflict, collecting tanks and other assorted 'powerups' along the way, and watching the humourous cutscenes as you go.
