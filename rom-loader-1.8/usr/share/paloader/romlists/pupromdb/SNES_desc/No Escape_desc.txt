"Not too bad, Not too good"

This game was based on a movie that never did so well, so it seemed somewhat strange to come out with this game. I am kinda happy they did though. It is somewhat interesting, it takes strategy and thought. Most people never touched this game, and I can see why, no advertisement, and it was and is pretty hard to find. well with no further ado, heres my review.

Graphics: 5/10
Even for Super Nintendo these graphics are pretty bad. Sometimes it looks better than other times, and the drawings of the characters from the movies are good.

Sound: 6/10
Not good at all, but for the time, I can't complain so much. The grunts and such were depicted somewhat well, and explosions sounded decent. I mean don't expect a soundtrack like that of Breath of Fire 1/2 or Chrono Trigger, but don't expect to get overly annoyed with it either.

Controls: 5/10
Not really very reactant. Takes getting used to. For example, if you were to push the jump button it might take a second to jump. When you begin to get used to the controls, it stops being a problem. I also found during the trading sequences, there were ways to trade better items for worse, but I never figured out how to do this. The manual isn't very helpful in this matter.

Gameplay: 7.5/10
I guess this is probably where the game shines the most. The first few times you play, it is very interesting. You have to use your head in this game, and that can hurt. You need to use objects with other objects, to get past another area, or to make a even better object. My major complaint, is at a certain point, you are stuck with a battle, where you can not use weapons, and must fight a man while someone else drops things on you and spikes come up from the ground. this battle is impossible, and completely ruins the game. There is nowhere to go from here.

Replay Value: 8.5 in the beginning, later 3.5.
Like I said before, until you get to the impossible part of the game, it can be frustrating gameplay, but fun. I found myself playing it a good amount of times, but can't even touch it now.

Overall: 6/10
I think this is a game worth renting or trying out, but buying wise, you might want to leave it alone. It really isn't the worse game I have ever played, but it falls far short from being a good game.
Worth Renting, Not Worth Buying!
