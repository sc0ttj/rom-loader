Most people don't know that there are alternate modes of the game Recca, which are accessed by very obscure means.

This hack makes them selectable from the start, adds a new title screen and translates the sound test mode as well (See the readme on how to access this).

New Modes - 
Hard - 7 levels as opposed to the 4 normally available. Can be toggled on or off with Select on the title screen.

Zanki Attack - Same as either normal or hard mode with three differences enemies explode into bullets, you start with 50 lives and there is no ending sequence. Score is determined by how many lives you have left when you beat the game.
