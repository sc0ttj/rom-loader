Super Mario Bros 3 - 2nd Run is the latest of my "Level only" hacks. Building on what I have learned from my previous hack, SMB3-2R is in many ways even better then my first attempt. The same commitment has gone into this hack to make it a great game to play. I have invested even more time into this hack then my previous one, and it shows -- at least this is what many people who have tried it have told me. Give this a try, I don't believe you will be disappointed.
