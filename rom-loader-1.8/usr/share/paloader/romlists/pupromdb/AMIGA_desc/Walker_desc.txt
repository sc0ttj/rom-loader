Walker is classic 2D shooter with the side-scrolling from the right to the left. Player takes control of gigantic robot AG-9 (codename Walker). The mission is simple - guide Walker through the four time zones and kill everybody/destroy everything. Every zone is also divided into two parts. The road is full of trained enemies with one single purpose - to destroy Walker. However, except relative immunity, the robot is equipped with twin 30mm carbines cannons. The number of enemies are actually huge, they are attacking in groups, off the ground and from the air. Also, every time zone consist of special types of enemies which force player to stay alert. As usual, there is a powerful boss at the end of level (luckily each boss has its own weak spot).
