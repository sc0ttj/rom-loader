With the defection of Jimmy Lee, the Shadow Master must recruit a new Second in Command...

Jimmy: Good to be back on the Light Side, Bro! Let's Clean-Up this town!

Double Dragon 5 is very different from its predecessors. This is the first Double Dragon that wasn't a side scroller. This game was actually a fighter. It's a lot like Street Fighter, or Mortal Kombat. There are three modes of gameplay, tournament, versus, and quest mode. In tournament mode, you will fight people at random, it's a good way to prepare for quest mode. In versus mode, you will need a friend to beat up. In quest mode, it will tell you a sort of cheesy story as to why you have to fight all these people. It's not a bad game except for the fact it's been done a million times, but I guess it's a decent change from the same old Double Dragon story. If you are a fan of fighting games or a fan of Double Dragon, this game is for you.
