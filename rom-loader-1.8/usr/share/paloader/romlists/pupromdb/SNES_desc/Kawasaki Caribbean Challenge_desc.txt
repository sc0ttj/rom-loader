Kawasaki Caribbean Challenge is a Super NES racing game where either one or two players can race Kawasaki vehicles across the Caribbean islands. There are a lot of treacherous curves and bends on the race track as the player(s) race for top supremacy and for a finish in the top spot. This game was released around the same time as the Kawasaki Ninja toys from Power Wheels.
