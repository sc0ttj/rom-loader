The sequel to Digimon Battle Spirit combines all the intense fighting from the original game with brand-new features. In Digimon Battle Spirit 2, you must restore peace in Digital World by defeating Kerpymon. As in the previous game, you can collect spirit balls that let you "digivolve" into beast form. This time, you can use ancient spirits to digivolve into ancient. You can also unlock an exclusive minigame in single-player mode or link up with a friend for two-player head-to-head battles.
