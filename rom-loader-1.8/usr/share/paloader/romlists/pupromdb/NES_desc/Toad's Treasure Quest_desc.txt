Toad's Treasure Quest is my latest SMB 1 romhack. The foundation of this romhack is what makes it special and very fun to play. A fellow romhacker, Googie, put together a rom containing hacks from various open-source Japanese SMB hacks. He then changed all the GFX and sent me the file for a collaboration project. That project ended up dieing unfortunately. But after a couple months, I found myself with some free time and decided to make a new SMB hack using this incredible hack as a starting point.

This hack contained new music, new GFX, conveyor belts, new lead character animations and upside down pipes/piranha plants. None of the levels were actually changed though. So I loaded up SMB Utility and went to town. I created 16 original levels making sure to utilize these cool new features. This romhack is definitely easier than my previous SMB Bowser's Jumping Challenge and the levels flow much more smoothly.

The story involves how Toad came to posses all those useful items in SMB3. In this hack, you search for those warp flutes. Yes, I know Toad doesn't actually give you those flutes in SMB3. Just pretend he finds em and intends on giving them to Mario, but then Toad trips on a Goomba and drops the flutes which then get stolen by Bowser's henchmen.
