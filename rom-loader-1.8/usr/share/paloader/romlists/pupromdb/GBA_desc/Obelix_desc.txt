No information about this European Game Boy game online.  

Also known as Asterix & Obelix.  Every rom says that's the name, but when you play it, it's just Obelix.  ~Rx
Obelix is an Action game, published by Infogrames, which was released in Europe in 1995.

I'm not sure why, but every rom titled "Asterix & Obelix" for GBC is actually just "Obelix".  Even the boxart for the game says "Asterix & Obelix".  ~Rx
