One Must Fall 2097 is a fighting game with a twist. Instead of the usual Street Fighter II trend of games, in this game you play one of 10 characters controlling one of 10 huge robots in a fighting match.

According to the game, in the year 2097, the human race is controlled by one company known as W.A.R., which started as a small company providing the Earth government with construction robots. After a while W.A.R. grew further and further and eventually took over Earth Gov.

In the year 2097, W.A.R. decided to colonize Ganymede, one of Jupiter's moons. Because of the harsh climate and difficult terrain, they sought for one person, the best of the best, to rule Ganymede for them. They've decided the best way to choose this person is to organize a huge contest, in which the winner will earn a seat in the W.A.R. high counsel and control of Ganymede.

You're one of the contestants, and you want to win.

Trivia:

According to Epic MegaGames' online newsletter MEGANEWS (#9 - October 11, 1995), Epic Megagames had planned to release a sequel called OMF II (working title only) which was going to be a Windows 95 game. They were going to port the gameplay of OMF: 2097 to Windows 95 and add SGI/Alias rendered 3D graphics created by a former professional comic artist. Although no projected release date had been set, Epic was intending to release the sequel sometime in 1996.
