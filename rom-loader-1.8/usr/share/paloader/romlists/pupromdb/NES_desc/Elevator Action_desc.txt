As super-sleuth Agent 17, code name "Otto", you must come out from undercover to accept a top-secret mission. Your country's security is at stake.

You must sneak through a heavily guarded, top-security enemy defense building to steal secret government documents. Only well-planned strategies, bullet- dodging, quick-on-the-draw accuracy and black belt karate prowess will allow you to succeed!

If you fail, your government will deny any knowledge of your or of your assignment.

Good luck!
