It's a simulated pinball table, pretty simple concept really. Use the flippers to keep the ball in play. Try to aim for certain targets on the board for extra points, extra balls, etc. When things go wrong, throw a fit, scream a lot, and blame video game physics.

Directions:

Choose between three different tables: Jolly Joker, Blackbeard and Ironmen, and Wizard. Each has a different setting and layout. There are two different game modes: Competition, which is a single game, and Conquest, a tournament game which makes you play through each table one after another.

Controls:

A Button - Activates right flipper
B Button - Launches ball
X Button - Tilt
Y Button - No use
L Button - Activates left flipper
R Button - Activates right flipper
Start Button - Starts game, pause/unpause

Tips:

999,999,000 points and lets you see the end of the game

In the Password screen enter CRUSHEND and then you'll receive 999,999,000 points.  Score more 900 points and you will also be able to see the end of the game.
