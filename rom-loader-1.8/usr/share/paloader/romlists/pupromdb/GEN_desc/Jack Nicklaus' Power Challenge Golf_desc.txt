Jack Nicklaus' Power Challenge Golf is a Golf game, published by Accolade, which was released in 1993. 

Hints:

- Space Game Easter Egg -
Go fifty over par on a hole, and the game turns into an action packed space game. Some versions may need 100 over par on the hole.

- Change the wind conditions -
If you are playing a game and you don't like the way the wind is blowing, simply save the game and reload it.
