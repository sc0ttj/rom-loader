Dragon Warrior 4 was probably the best game of the series. It was longer than its predecessors, and the graphics were a little better, too. In Dragon Warrior 4 you get to play as several different characters and then get to play all of them at the end. I liked this method pretty well. You get to develop a relationship with each of the characters as you go along, and then get to team them up against your common enemy.
