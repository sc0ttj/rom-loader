Based on the arcade game, in Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters you are sent in on a rescue mission to Planet X. This planet has been taken over by robots and you must find and evacuate the remaining humans.

It's a shooter similar to Gauntlet, only with an isometric viewpoint. You run around the levels shooting robots, rescuing humans and picking up items.

CHEATS:

Avoid Reptilion:
While fighting an end of level Boss, move across the
fighting area to the wall on the other side. Keep walking into
the wall at a point where two blocks meet and repeatedly drop
bombs and rotate the Joystick. Your character will eventually
walk through the wall and avoid Reptilion.
