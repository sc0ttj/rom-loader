This is a ROM hack of Super Mario RPG that shows off what you can do with the statistical, gameplay (battle system-wise aspects of the of this masterpiece constructed by the combined efforts of Nintendo and Squaresoft (now Square Enix) mostly, but also shows what you can do in terms of attack animations and other.

- Characters can go level up to Level 50

- All bosses and enemies' battle scripts changed

- Character stats changed around

- Spells changed

- All Enemy stats changed

- Dialogue changes (Mostly in-battle, but some out-of-battle as well)

- New enemies and enemy name changes

- Well-balanced difficulty curve

- Timing for Weapons, defense and spells changed considerably

- A few new attacks and spells

- Some new items and equipments

Changes made from Remix:

- Solves problems with some enemies/bosses with multiple attacks (i.e. Enemies attacking after characters have died, leads to bug where enemy jumps offscreen and attacks nothing, only to come back some minutes later).

- Mallow with Shocker at the beginning instead of Thunderbolt as his first spell (Some enemies changed a bit to compensate for this).

- Balance out stats between characters and increase HP stat boosts

- Change enemy encounters around a bit (i.e. Mushroom Way, a Goomba encounter might give you two Goombas and a Koopa Troopa).

- Improved certain boss and enemy tactics as well as stats to make a little tougher/more balanced.

- Fixed the bug where it says that your character will gain a new special at Level 51. The max level is 50 in this game.

- Changed Geno Whirl's stats (It will always hit now, sometimes will hit 9999 on its own, but timing for guaranteed 9999 is VERY hard like Geno Boost's).

- Changed stats for a few pieces of equipment (Masher, Lazy Shell).

- ALL Weapons have small changes to timing (Mainly just for the strongest level of the attack).

- Changes to most Psychopath messages

- Fixed problem with "Ready, Get Set, Go!" message on Booster Hill.

- Small fixes with some out-of-battle text messages

- Improved enemy evasion for most enemies.

- Balanced FP cost and all-targeting attacks

- Lessened overall EXP gain to compensate for Lucky Jewel, Lucky! Bonus, and the special Hammer.

- EXP Booster costs twice the amount of Coin Trick now.

- Balanced the stat-boosting items
