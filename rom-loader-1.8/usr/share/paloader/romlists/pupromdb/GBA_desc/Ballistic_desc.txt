Much the same as the first title, Ballistic is a 1st person shooter at heart, where you play as ex-FBI agent Ecks and former NSA operative Sever. You must progress through the game as either of the two main characters, gunning down the bad guys along your intended path while also using the latest spy gear to your advantage in gaining access to certain areas and avoiding hazards. 24 missions await you, based in locations around the world.

The story takes place after the events of the first title, where Ecks originally tried to hunt down Sever. Here, they work together to discover the secrets behind a worldwide weapon cartel, and only they can shut it down before things get out of hand.

Two player co-operative campaigns add to the package, where you'll play as both characters through a number of missions. Up to four can compete in Deathmatch, capture the flag and many other multiplayer modes.

Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.

Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player's success results in additional balls on the other player's screen which they then must clear.
