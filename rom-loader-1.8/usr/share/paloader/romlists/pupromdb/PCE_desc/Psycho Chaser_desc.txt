Psycho Chaser is a vertically scrolling shooter that has you taking control of a heavily armed cyborg. Players must guide their cyborgs through a series of stages blasting or evading the enemies before confronting the bosses at the end of each level. Played from an angled top-down view, Psycho Chaser's background scenery scrolls forward at a fixed rate, and players' cyborgs run along with the scenery.

Players can rotate between four basic weapons at any point in the game. The default weapon emits a strong blast of fire. Players can also choose from a spread shot that fires one shot straight ahead and two shots diagonally back, a side shot that destroys anything on either side of the cyborg, or a homing energy vortex that remains on the screen for a certain amount of time doing damage to any enemies it homes in on.

These basic weapons can be upgraded individually throughout the game. Players can also collect up to three missile power-ups. Each power-up gives players the ability to shoot a pair of missiles, one to either side, at fixed intervals.

Players begin the game with five lives. If an enemy unit or projectile attack touches a cyborg, it will die and the player loses a life. Players can also lose a life if their cyborgs are trapped behind an obstacle in such a way so that the screen scrolls forward past them. If players lose all their cyborgs, the game is over.
