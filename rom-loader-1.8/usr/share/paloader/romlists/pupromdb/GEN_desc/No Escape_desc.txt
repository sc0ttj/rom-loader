Based on the 1994 film of the same name (which starred Ray Liotta), No Escape drops you smack dab in the middle of Absolom Island, a multi-complex penitentiary known for its life sentences and the short life expectancy of its inmates. It seems you murdered your commanding military officer while you were in a dream-induced fit of rage.

You have heard through the grapevine that there is a place on the island called the village. The village is where the civilized inmates live. You want to go there at all costs, because it is your only hope for escape.

You begin the game in the thick of the jungle with nothing more than the clothes on your back and your years of combat training. You must run fast and avoid as many hazards (falling bags of sand, bursts of hot steam, spears in the ground, tree limbs and the like) as you can along the way. While you are on the run, Tree Dwellers, Techno Warriors and other prison thugs will come after you with darts, blowguns, knives and other weapons. Fight them off and avoid their fists and weapons. 

Throughout the game there are more than 150 objects for you to find, including an engine distributor, a hacksaw, tin snips, a rusty compass, shafts of wood, bolts, butane gas, an empty butane lantern, bulbs and an iron crowbar. Many of the objects can be combined to create new weapons and tools, such as a crossbow, sticks of dynamite or woodwork tools. 

A mapping system lets you enter the next destination you would like to explore. The village is a temporary safe haven where you can gain information and trade for new objects. The other four locations are filled with traps and enemies. Each of the sectors has multiple sub-sections to explore. Only when you have successfully completed a sub-sector can you move onto the next sub-sector in that area.
