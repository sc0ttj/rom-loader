In the future, human soldiers of John Conner's resistance force against the machines are fighting a losing war against Skynet and it's robot forces. Discovering that one of the foundation technologies for Skynet is the cybernetics technology used in the creation of Robocop. One of the resistances' soldiers, Flo is sent back in time before the Rise of the Machines to destroy Robocop and stop Skynet from being built. However Skynet learns of the time travel attempt and sends Terminators to stop Flo.

In the game you control Robocop who may move across the screen, jump, fire and exchange weapons. Robocop starts with the Auto-9 which has unlimited ammunition... other weapons may be more powerful but contain limited ammo. Beginning the game on a mission of law enforcement, you soon meet up with Flo and must engage in battle against Terminators, the forces of OCP and several obstacles.

The Terminator licensed game for the Sega consoles was a fairly standard side-scrolling platform game. However, the game's six levels mirror the story-line of The Terminator movie very closely as you take on the role of Kyle Reese and his quest to save Sarah Connor from termination.

Because the game follows the movie so closely, the first mission which involves blowing up the SkyNet computer and escaping through time is one of the hardest and something that most players remember with love/hate.
