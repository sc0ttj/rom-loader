In 2005, aliens have taken over Antarctica. You are sent in to combat them with the new super tank, the Slye-Hicks MX-100, Codename: Arcticfox. 

Arcticfox is a futuristic-based 3D tank simulation game where your overall goal is to destroy the invading aliens' main fortress before Arcticfox is destroyed.

Enemy targets come in all sorts of shapes and sizes: planes, tanks, recon sleds and other important targets such as communication towers, atmosphere converters, etc. Your state-of-the-art killing machine is equipped with a cannon, guided missiles and mines at your disposal in addition to radar and forward/aft view-screens to detect your enemy advances.

Game designed by Damon Slye. The 3D world of ARCTICFOX was created by coder Paul Bowman using a proprietary graphics package called 3-Space. 

The inside cover of the original EA release (English and German versions) identifies the Dynamix coders in a photo and discusses development of the game (see Box scans).

ARCTICFOX represented Dynamix's first major development contract. They were given a whopping US$35,000 budget for the game by EA and developed it on a pre-release Amiga packaged in a black steel box with a wooden keyboard [Source: Damon Slye].

The words 'We build Worlds' shown in the game intro was the motto adopted by developers Dynamix.
