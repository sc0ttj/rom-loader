Bio Senshi Dan - Increaser tono Tatakai is a Sci-Fi Action Adventure game, developed and published by Jaleco Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1987.

This is the cancelled US prototype of Bio Senshi Dan, which is included in the translated section.  This game is easier and is different enough to warrant keeping though.  ~Rx
