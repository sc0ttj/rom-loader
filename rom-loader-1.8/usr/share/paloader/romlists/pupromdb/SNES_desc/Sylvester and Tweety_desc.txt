Sylvester and Tweety was in development by Visual Concepts by October 1993, as indicated by this short demo. This demo consists of one short scene with Sylvester and Tweety roaming around the room, and another demonstration of the character art.

According to Rene Boutin, a producer at Sunsoft, a one level demo was shown at CES or E3 around 1994 and 1995. In the demo, you controlled Sylvester. The game was advertised in a Sunsoft advertisement in 1995, though it is unknown how close it was to completion. When Sunsoft of America went under, most games that were near completion were sold to Acclaim, so it is unlikely this game was ready for release.
