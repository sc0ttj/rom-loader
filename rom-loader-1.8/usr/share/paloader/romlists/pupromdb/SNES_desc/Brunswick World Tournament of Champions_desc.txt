Brunswick World: Tournament of Champions is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System bowling game that engages players in the life of a league bowler. The player can play exhibition mode or league mode for all the fun of bowling in a local league without the social interaction and/or dating. In addition to this, the player must choose the weight of his bowling ball. The lighter it is, the more force the player needs to make a strike.
