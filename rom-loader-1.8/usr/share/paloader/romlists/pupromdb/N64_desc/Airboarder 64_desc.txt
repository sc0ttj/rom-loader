Air Boarder 64 (??????? 64?) is a futuristic hoverboard racing game for the Nintendo 64 released in 1998. It was to be released under the name AirBoardin' USA in North America by ASCII Entertainment, but was cancelled.[2] The reason it is thought to be cancelled is because of the quantity of levels and rushed design.
