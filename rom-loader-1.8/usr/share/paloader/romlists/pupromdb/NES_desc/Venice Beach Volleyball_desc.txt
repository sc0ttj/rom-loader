Venice Beach Volleyball is no doubt the coolest video game under the hot summer sun. Check it out! We took miles of clear blue sky, warm sand, along with millions of gnarly 8-foot waves, mixed in dudes, babes, and one ton of pure fun, then crammed the whole thing with the maximum amount of challenge and excitement allowable by federal law. Here you have it, the most excellent beach volleyball game ever! Locals say kicking the butt of a computer-controlled team is never easy without a lot of practice. You haven't seen anything until you challenge a friend head to head in competitive double player action mode. Way rad beach volleyball action, blazing 8-bit graphics and killer tunes. That's what VENICE BEACH VOLLEYBALL is all about!

Hints - 

Always try to spike the ball as any times as possible. Just set up a great spike and jump to time your shot right. Just spike as much as possible and try not to knock it out of bounds. If you spike the ball right every time, then it will be very easy to win. 

If they spike, you will have to predict where the ball will go. Try to predict where the ball will go right when you see them jump. You will have to get there quick and you may have to dive sometimes so be ready. 

If you ever have to dive to keep the ball alive, just toss the ball to them. Don't try to spike it to their side or anything because you will probably just mess up and the only person who could save you will be on the ground.
