Ninja JaJaMaru-kun (meaning 'determined little ninja') was originally released for the Japanese Famicom (NES) in Japan in 1985. This action game features a ninja called JaJaMaru, who uses his shuriken (ninja throwing stars) to defeat monsters and save Princess Sakura from the evil Lord Namazu Dayuu.

Use special items to aid your quest (including a giant frog that you can ride!) as you fight across multiple stages filled with uniquely Japanese ghosts and monsters.
