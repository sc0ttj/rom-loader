Packy and Marlon are diabetic elephants who must remember to take their medication throughout the day and eat healthily. At the end of the game they face the evil bosses Veets and Yebur of the Lunch Room Crew who force them to eat highly refined snacks and drinks which raise their blood sugar level.

A six month study undertaken in 1999 on behalf of Click Health by researchers at Stanford University's Medical Center on 60 diabetic children ages 8 to 16 found that after playing the game the children were four times less likely to require urgent care visits than children who had played other games.
