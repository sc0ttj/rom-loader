The Great Wall is tearing down! What shocking information! No wonder the Emperor Ching got mad. Here is his warning to people who want to play this game - If you are not afraid to die, come over here. Do you want to be a hero or a chicken? If you think you are qualified to be a great hero, bring your big hammer, and come! The Emperor Ching is waiting for you at the other end of the "Tunnel of Time!"
