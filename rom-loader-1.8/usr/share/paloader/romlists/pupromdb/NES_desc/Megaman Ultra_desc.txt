This is one of those Megaman 2 hacks that just has to be played, for one the whole soundtrack is changed! The challenge is very good and all of the graphics has been changed to give this hack some extra flavor. There are graphics from other games too but that's a suprise. Megaman fans will get a kick out of this hack as much as everone else will enjoy it. Infidelity did a really good job with this hack and it shows, so what are you waiting for? Download this hack and get ready for an all new adventure of Megaman 2. :D
