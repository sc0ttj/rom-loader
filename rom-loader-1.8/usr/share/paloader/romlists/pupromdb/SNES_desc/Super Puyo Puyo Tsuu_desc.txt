Tips:

Best ending
In normal Puyo Puyo mode, have at least 180 000 experience and don't use any continue to fight Masked Satan after Rulue instead of Satan. Defeat him to view the best ending.

Custom menu
In the options, enter game mode and let the cursor on exit game mode 10-15 seconds. Instead of the description, there will be a message saying 'Huh?  You've discovered the secret area. Now you can access the custom menu. '. Quit game mode and now you can enter custom, which allows you to limit the colors of the puyo puyo and watch a match between CPU.

Easy win with high experience
In the custom menu, limit the colors of Puyo Puyo to 2 (put color minus to 3). Now try to fight the CPU and make disappear all the puyo puyo on your side of the field as quickly as possible, it sends 4 lines of garbage puyo to the opponent. It becomes far easier to win because the CPU is slow to clear his field and you will earn more than 20 000 experience after each fight.

PS: In the first fights in normal puyo puyo, there seems to be only one color of puyo so you just have to press down and wait some time, the CPU always loses.
