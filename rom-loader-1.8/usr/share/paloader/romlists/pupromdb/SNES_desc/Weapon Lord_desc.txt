In an age of conquerors, on a bloody battlefield... a wounded mercenary draws his last breath... and the spirit of a demon enters his body. He is reborn, rising from the dead to challenge the residing war king to a duel. With one blow a new empire is started...10 days and 20 dead rulers later the armies and lands are united by one man's hand. The reign of the DemonLord Zarak has begun.

At the height of the demon's power, the prophecy of his doom was foretold by a tribal shaman...

"When the night turns violent and the moon bleeds, gripped by the skeletal fingers of death...a child will rise to face the demon in combat...and the lord of demons will fall by the hand of...the WeaponLord."

Against the advice of his lieutenants to kill the children born that night, the DemonLord waits to face his foretold killer in fair, one on one combat. The DemonLord Zarak is a true warrior, even evil can have honor.

25 years later...

Sensing the prophecy is at hand, the DemonLord holds a great tournament of champion warriors. The winner will face the demon in a final battle. The Demonlord prepares to meet his destiny head on...and destroy the WeaponLord.
