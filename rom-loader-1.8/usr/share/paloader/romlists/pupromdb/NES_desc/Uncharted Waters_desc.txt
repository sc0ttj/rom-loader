Make history as a young Portuguese captain, as you set sail towards fame and riches. With your first mate steering the ship, you'll make your way to distant lands on a series of complex missions and breathtaking adventures. Stubborn merchants will sell you rare spices and valuable gems, which you can then sell to turn a profit.

Use your money to upgrade your fleet, or buy supplies to help you in your struggles against pirates, storms, and more. You'll have an armada of historically accurate sailing vessels as you try to reach famous 16th Century ports. If you can win a few new allies for Portugal, the King will reward you handsomely. Anchors aweigh and port ho!
