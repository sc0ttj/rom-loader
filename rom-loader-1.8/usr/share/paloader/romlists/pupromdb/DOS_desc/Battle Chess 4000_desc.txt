The Battle Chess series took the basic game of chess and added animations for each battle between pieces, bringing the game to a wider audience, with no intention of providing something for Kasparov to spar with. This edition follows the same premise, but with a futuristic science-fiction feel. Pieces are animated from clay models, with a new range of animations. The game can be played in 2D mode as an alternative.

The game's artificial intelligence learns your strategies and game plan as it plays with you, and there are over 30,000 distinct moves in the library of openings.
