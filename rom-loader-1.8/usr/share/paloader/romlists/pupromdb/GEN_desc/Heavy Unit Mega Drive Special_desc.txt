Set in 2013, Heavy Unit sees mankind's first artificial star, "Le Tau", come under attack from genetically modified monsters. The player must navigate a "Heavy Unit", a heavily armed, transforming mecha, in order to defeat the onslaught and protect the human colony.

Gameplay:

Heavy Unit is a typical side-scrolling shooter in which you have to fly through several levels filled with enemies, mid and end bosses. Apart from the usual power ups that increase your speed and weapons, there is also one that transforms your spaceship into a large robot that has a different weapon system.
