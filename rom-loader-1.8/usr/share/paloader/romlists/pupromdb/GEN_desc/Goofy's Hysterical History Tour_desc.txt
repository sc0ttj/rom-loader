Goofy finally finds a job that he likes at the Ludwig von Drake History Museum and he turns into a great janitor worker. But his enemy Pete is out to get him fired by sabotaging the exhibits. Goofy must recover the missing pieces of the exhibits, defeat Pete, and save his job all before the curator comes in tomorrow. With Goofy's Extend-O-Hand, you'll have to travel through time in order to complete your mission.

Gameplay:

The game is a platformer, where Goofy must travel through various stages ranging from Prehistoric times, Medieval times, Colonial America and the Wild West among many others, collecting items and power-ups and defeating Pete's henchmen using the Extend-O-Hand. After collecting all the pieces, Goofy then must face Pete himself.
