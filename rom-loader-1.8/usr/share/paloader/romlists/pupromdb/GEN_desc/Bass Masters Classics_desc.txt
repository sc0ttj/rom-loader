The story to this game actually has a pretty interesting premise as compared to other fishing games I've played.  Bass Master's Classic isn't your typical fishing for the sake of fishing game. Now, there's actually something at stake. You can choose which fisherman you are and compete in a tournament to see which one of you reel masters can bag the biggest bass. The fact that there's an actual point to the repetitive gameplay is one of this game's few redeeming qualities.

Like I said in the synopsis: fun for the first five minutes. When you start out, it is kind of fun to be able to buy some equipment, and customize everything (your rods, reels, lures, etc.), and then you'll have fun steering your boat around to find a good place to fish on the lake. Then, you cast your line and the monotony begins. You wait for a fish to bite... and you wait... and you wait.. and you wait. You spend more time waiting in this game than actually playing. Sometimes, you do catch a fish... only to find out that its a trout and doesn't count in your tournament score.

Take my word for it, this game is so beguiling and dull that you'll spend 5 or 10 minutes saying ''Oh! This is going to be so cool!'' But then once you actually start to fish, you'll be ripping your hair out and screaming something along the lines of ''You #$@! stupid punk of a fish! Bite ^&%$ you!'' Oh so very much fun...
