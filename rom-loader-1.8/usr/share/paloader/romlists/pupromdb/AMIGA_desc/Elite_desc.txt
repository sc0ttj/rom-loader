You have a ship with virtually no equipment. Take her and trade among the different star systems. You can be safe and trade on razor-thin margins among the safe systems, or take some risks and trade with anarchic systems while watching out for pirates. You can save on fuel costs by buying a fuel scoop and fly near the sun, but again, watch out for pirates! Or be a pirate yourself and raid other ships...  Don't get a bad rep as the police will come after you... Dock with space stations and do your trades (some may take contraband...) Upgrade your ship with your proceeds with better weapons,  shields, and other equipment. With 8 different galaxies, each with HUNDREDS of planets, there are plenty of room for exploration! Can you make your reputation all the way up to "elite"?

CHEATS:

Further jumps:
This technique can result in a distance of 80 light
years in about two jumps. Buy some fuel and launch from the station.
Press [F6] to display the local cluster chart and select
a planet that lies within the fuel range. Press H to jump
into hyperspace and the pointer will disappear.  However, it may
still be moved even though it is invisible.  Move the pointer
to a planet outside the range and press to get the local chart
for that planet.  This must be done within the ten second limit
of the countdown.  This should cause the jump to move to the selected
planet, well outside the 7.2 light year range. 

Control ship preview:
Press A when the rotating ships appear on the
opening screen to stop their movement.  Use the cursor keys to
rotate the ships.  Hold A and press a cursor key to rotate
them differently.  Press O or I to zoom in and out.
 Press D to continue.

View credits:
Press W when flying to view your score and the
credits.

Longer song:
Press H to jump into hyperspace, then engage
the docking computer when the counter is below 5.  The song, The
Blue Danube will play until your ship reaches the next station.

Cheat mode:
Enter SARA or SUZANNE when prompted for
a word from the manual during the copy protection check. Then,
enter a valid word when the prompt appears again. Press [Keypad
Plus] and/or [Keypad Asterisk] during game play to
display the cheat screen. A prompt for a byte and new value will
appear. Enter the first number of the set, press [Enter],
enter the second number, press [Enter], then press [Esc]
to resume game play. Note: Press [Help] to edit the amount
of arms and cargo.  Additionally, this will not work in the Space
Legends compilation version of the game.

Frontier: Elite 2 is, of course, the sequel to Elite and it continues in much the same way. You have a ship and limited funds, and nowhere to go but out into space. Trade, fight, hunt criminals, work for the various governments, anything goes in Frontier. There are few, if any, limits on what you can do or where you can go. And Frontier's universe (with approx. 100,000,000,000 planets and moons) is so big you'll never see the end of it.
