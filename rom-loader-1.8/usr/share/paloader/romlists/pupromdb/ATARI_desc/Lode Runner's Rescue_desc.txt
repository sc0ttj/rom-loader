You are Lode Runner's daughter, desperately trying to rescue your famous father from the clutches of the Bungeling Empire.  The Galactic Commando was captured while trying to recover stolen treasure, and now only you can save him.

You'd better be in great shape, because you'll be running, jumping and swimming through 46 challenging mazes on the way to his prison cell.  Your only weapons are your quick reflexes and even quicker wits, plus a magic mushroom or two.  Good luck, you'll need it!

And once you've rescued Lode Runner, the fun is just beginning! Lode Runner's Rescue also includes a powerful, icon-driven Game Editor that helps you desing, construct and save an unlimited number of mazes.  The easy-to-use Editor lets you decide where the elevators, trapdoors, keys, enemy guards, rivers and mushrooms should go,  so you can make the mazes just as hard as you want.  Then playtest each new screen before you save it permanently, just like the pros do.
