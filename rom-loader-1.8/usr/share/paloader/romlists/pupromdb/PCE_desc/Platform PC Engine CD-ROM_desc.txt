The Cho Aniki series returns with their first sequel, the one that would cement the series humorous fetish with bodybuilders and other assorted stuff. As in the original Cho Aniki, Ai Cho Aniki is a side-scrolling shooter in which you have to clear several stages of enemies with your flying avatar. Said avatar this time can be either of the two "option" bodybuilders that were supporting characters in the original while the original's main cast plays only small cameo roles as they appear every now and then to drop power-ups.

Our two beloved speedo-wearing beefcakes also incorporate different play mechanics, as their attacks are often determined by button combinations (as in fighting games) which put a spin on the gameplay. Otherwise, the game's graphics and design are practically identical to the first game.

In this coin-op conversion, you are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With a scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.

Yuri Sakazaki has been kidnapped! Her big brother Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, his best friend, go search for her on the streets of South Town. As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.

Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.

The most sought-after game in the entire Castlevania series, and the one we should've gotten in the first place (I hate you, Konami), Dracula X: Rondo of Blood had multiple secret stages, CD audio, awesome synth music, and animated cutscenes. And the game rocked too!

It's Castlevania on steroids. You don't have the multiple-direction whip from Castlevania IV, but in its place you have an item crash, which is a super attack which changes depending on your secondary weapon.

I'd write more, but I haven't played much of it. But know that it rocks. And that the SNES version has nothing to do with this game. OK, so the SNES version is a retooling, but this is much better.

The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy & Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

Another day at Nekketsu High, another gang tournament... but this time its different! A wealthy school principal has placed a challenge for all the school gangs to compete in a special obstacle course composed of 4 different challenges that you and your team must overcome. First in line is a race across the city streets (and rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in which you have to break a series of metal balls, and finally an all-out fighting tournament.

The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay mechanics featured in other Nekketsu High games, with the only change being the goals you must complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the characters are gang members, fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can also be found in the courses

Fatal Fury Special is an improved version of SNK's 2D one-on-one fighter Fatal Fury 2. It's a conversion of the 1993 arcade game of the same name. The objective is still to win the tournament by defeating all other fighters including end boss Wolfgang Krauser. Fatal Fury Special features a fairly large selection of fighters that includes:

- The four bosses from Fatal Fury 2: Billy Kane, Axel Hawk, Lawrence Blood and Wolfgang Krauser (this time they're all immediately playable).

Other improvements include:

- A new Count Down mode (defeat as many opponents as possible in 3 minutes).

- Extra color schemes for every character.

- New & improved background graphics.

- Dolby Surround Sound support.

Gain Ground is an arcade style action game with a bit of strategy thrown in. The goal is get all of the soldiers to the opposite side of the screen or to kill all of the enemies. Each soldier in the army has a unique specialization, from among 20 types. Each soldier can attack in two different ways, using either a normal weapon or a special weapon. The strategy comes from deciding which soldier would do best in which situation. Some weapons are better at dealing with certain enemies and obstacles than other weapons.

Players start with only three soldiers but can encounter other soldiers that can be rescued, by touching them. If the new solider survives long enough to reach the exit, they can be added to the soldier inventory. The number of possible soldier in a player's army is over 30 soldiers. There are 50 stages total, divided into rounds of 10. At the end of each round, players encounter an enemy boss.

This was released as a pack-in game with the "Super PC Engine Fan Deluxe" magazine, and is consequently rare beyond rare now. However if you ARE lucky enough to get a hold of a (cough) genuine copy, you're in for one HELL of a party game. It's no Bomberman 95 for sure, but it ranks pretty high up there I think. Anyway you're a duck. You compete with other ducks to get eggs. These eventually hatch into little ducks (or chickens? I dunno) and they walk into your base, and thus earning you points. There are lots of powerups so you can kick ass, and many ways to be completely vicious to the other players. Like, you can get into a fight with another teammate. Whoever loses, loses all the eggs and powerups they've collected so far. You can also place little roadblocks in the path, so other people's duckys change direction and walk into your base, thus earning YOU points. It's a crazy crazy game, and it's four-player-capable. Very highly recommended, this game is.

Translation Description:

The game is completely translated with this patch. Have fun.

There's two patches here; use the IPS patch on the data tracks if you have the ISO/MP3 thing, and use the PPF patch if you have the BIN/CUE thing. There's instructions in the readme if you get confused. Kay?

The translation was tested with both the PPF patch and the IPS patch and both work fine! So there should be no problems, whatever your choice of ripping method may be.

Yuko Ahso was once an ordinary high school girl. Or least her life used to be ordinary. Her friend Reiko went out on a date with a Dark King named Rogles, and has vanished. Immediately, monsters attacked her. She was almost killed...

Until a mystic sword named Valis appeared before her.

Using the sword, Yuko defended herself against the monsters, and was whisked to a strange land, where she was told that she was the chosen Valis Warrior, and she must defeat Rogles, or the human world and the dream world would both be plunged into chaos.

Go forth, brave Valis Warrior, and destroy the evil known as Rogles!

The year is 2089AD. In Russia, the evil Grand Master Meio has begun his insane plot to take over the universe. A lone figure drops from a stealth glider into Meio's base. He is Hiryu, Super A-Class Strider. His mission is to defeat the Grand Master and put an end to his plotting once and for all.

Converted from the classic arcade game, Strider lets you run, jump, perform acrobatics and climb walls and overhangs. You wield a plasma sword, called a Cypher, through 5 levels fighting robots and guards, with mid- and end-level bosses.

Yup, it's Daisenryaku. And don't think the neat CD storage capabilities will improve upon the tried-and-true formula; it's still Daisenryaku. It does include some neat sound effects though. Like all Daisenryaku games, this is for the hardcore only. No hand-holding here, just a bunch of maps for you to play. Still, it's pretty fun, even if it IS pretty slow, and you don't know what you're doing half the time. Maybe all the true hardcore armchair generals will find it more fun, I think.

Translation Description:

Now just so you know, the stats for the units repeat themselves in the ISO like, hundreds of times, so you'll probably eventually see some Japanese here and there, but I think it's okay enough to still be considered complete. Come on, even we at the Whirlpool aren't THAT picky. Aside from that, this is a great-looking translation, so check it out if you feel so inclined.

Darius was Taito's effort to compete in the arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem's and Konami's offerings.

When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus.

The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld.

What sets Darius apart from other shoot'em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by. Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type's and Gradius'.

Carmen Sandiego is a master thief who leads the criminal organization V.I.L.E. This organization specializes in stealing the world's treasures without a trace. Alarmed by this, the A.C.M.E. Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego's plans.

Carmen Sandiego is an game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country.

This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away. Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.

The time traveling tournament fighters are back! The original eight characters from the popular arcade hit return, along with six new characters hand-picked from several different eras and locations all through time. But a new boss awaits the victor... who or what is behind this new tournament? You'll have to get to him to find out!

This sequel features all-new stages and music, and improved animation and graphics. You can now reflect projectile moves at your opponent, and reverse normal throws if your timing is right! The original game's Death Match mode is also back, but with a new feature - the life bar will increase or decrease as you inflict or receive damage. Get your side's life bar to 100% and your enemy will lose.

I haven't played very far into this yet because I don't want to spoil the game before any translations are complete, but from what I saw, it looks like the folks who made this took Ys, changed the sprites and tiles around a little, and decided it was now going to be called Xak. But Ys is cool, so at the least, this should be a decent game. The graphics are what you'd expect for a PCE game? but the music simply rocks, plain and simple. Yay for CD Audio!

And Spinner just wants to say that Fray is a total hottie. :)

The game is done! The game is done! Since I don't have the game itself I can't review it, but woohoo, the game is done! The patch is in PPF format, which you will need PPF-o-Matic to apply. It's also archived in a .cab instead of a .zip. The file includes instructions on how to rip and patch your legit copy of the game. Eheh.

After the dreadful, dreadful Ys III, it would appear that Falcom has gone back to the tried-and-true style of the first two Ys games: overhead view game play with Adol running at demons kamikaze-like. Seriously, it's Ys. Aside from Ys III, Nihon has never really deviated from the same basic formula.

Now I know this is kind of confusing, but there are two Ys IV games. In addition to this one, there was also Ys IV: Mask of the Sun for SNES, which was released just about a month before this game came out. Strangely, Nihon, perhaps in a step to protect the innocent, pulled some kind of Bizarro-Dragnet stunt. They kept the names and the places fairly identical in the two games, but they changed the plots. Both games are Ys IV, however, they have absolutely nothing to do with each other.

Now, in the various gaming circles of the INTERWEB, the argument of which game is better has raged for quite awhile, and I choose not to address that here. Most of the people who engage in such arguments most likely do not speak Japanese. Watching such things unfold on forums and IRC is kind of like watching a bunch of Canadians discussing American politics: nobody really knows what's going on, so everyone involved looks like a retard.

In conclusion, this is a cool game. But so is Mask of the Sun. I just wish there more English in it at the moment.

This patch is now complete and all future possible work(dubbing, one more script edit) on it was dropped. With that said, this game IS fully translated and the job was very well done. You will be able to enjoy this game completly from beginning to end.

Nightwolve and everyone involved in this project deserve a round of applause. They even included a lower-case font as well.

Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.
