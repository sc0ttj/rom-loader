Following closely from the original, PC Genjin 2 keeps the formula and makes a few tweaks, such as different power-up characters and limiting your ability to somersault as fast as before.

COMMENT:

The sequel bumps the graphics up to scratch and introduces more crazy bosses and bonus stages. It is a really quality, full platforming experience, but the inability to do really, really fast mid air somersaults can be a little frustrating at times if you are used to the original game.
