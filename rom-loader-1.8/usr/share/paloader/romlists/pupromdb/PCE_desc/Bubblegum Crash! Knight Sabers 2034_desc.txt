BubbleGum Crash. Straight from the series comes the digital comic adventure for PC Engine. Upon investigating a recent bank robbery incident, you soon learn that things aren't quite what they appear to be.

The game is played through a pick and click "digital comic" interface, requiring gathering clues and items and pestering? I mean interrogating anyone who might be suspicious or otherwise!
