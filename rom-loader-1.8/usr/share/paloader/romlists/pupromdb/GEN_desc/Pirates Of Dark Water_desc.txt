Developed for both Genesis and Super NES, this colorful combat game from Sunsoft is based on the Saturday morning cartoon show of the same title, created by David Kirschner. Each of the three main heroes from the animated series is playable: Ren, the beleaguered prince of Octopon; Tula, the supernaturally gifted "Ecomancer"; and Ioz, the battle-hardened former pirate. In the roles of these characters, players fight against the villain Bloth and his nefarious brigands as they side-scroll through eight stages of combat and action, in search of the Treasures of Rule. As in earlier 2D combat games, such as Double Dragon or Final Fight, two gamers can play at once on the same screen.
