If you've been acquainted with the movie Demolition Man, than you already know what the plot is. If not, then here's a brief summary: In the early 90's, over-the-top police officer John Spartan, who earns the name ''Demolition Man'' from his peers, is in search for his arch-nemesis, dangerous felon Simon Phoenix. When Spartan is blamed for the deaths of hundreds, he is cryogenically frozen for a given 70-odd year period. As is the captured Phoenix. When Phoenix is awakened in the distant future, in peaceful-as-hell San Angeles, he escapes. Due to the police not knowing how to deal with such a dangerous criminal, Spartan is rethawed and immediately set to bringing in Phoenix. Along with scenery from the movie, the game extends the plot of the movie, adding new levels and such to make the game longer, and in my opinion, better. For the entire game, you play as Spartan.
