"JUSTIN BAILEY  " was the famous password that allowed you to play as Samus without her armor suit in Metroid, a reward normally reserved for those who can finish the game in under three hours.

To the disappointment of many, there was no armorless Samus in Super Metroid. But this patch restores that feature- each sprite, and every graphic of Samus has been redrawn by hand to make armorless Samus playable once again.
