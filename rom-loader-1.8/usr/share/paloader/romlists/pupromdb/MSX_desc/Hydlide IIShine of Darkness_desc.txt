Hydlide II: Shine Of Darkness is a role-playing adventure game and the second installment in the Hydlide series.

In a different space a wonderful world existed called Fairy Land which was dominated by swords and magic after the times of domination by monsters and evil had ended. The people of Fairy Land were intoxicated with peace.

At that time an incident occurred. A Consciousness filled with evil awoke and it created new monsters and brought the dead back to life and wanted to dominate Fairy Land again.

The monks were one of the first who noticed this and warned the people about it but they didn't listen and left the monks disappointed.

The monks prayed to God and asked Him if there was a Savior. God, impressed by the monks prayers warped the space-time of Fairy Land with the human world and selected an innocent boy who lived in the human world.

The player controls the innocent boy and must roam the lands of Fairy Land and free it from evil while only equipped with a magical sword. Attack and defeat evil enemies and gain additional powers. In the villages you'll find shops where you can buy and sell items. Start your quest to defeat the Evil now.
