The competition is fierce. You've fought long and hard to get this far. You're gonna have to keep on winning to make it to the top. Six of the best international players have gathered to compete for a fortune in cash, plus the prestige that comes with winning the RAD RACKET trophy.

As you walk out onto the court a tense hush comes over the crowd. You pick up your favorite racket, you feel butterflies in your stomach and sweat on your palms. You're ready to give it everything you've got. Your advesary glares at you from across the court. Both are confident but there will be only one winner.
