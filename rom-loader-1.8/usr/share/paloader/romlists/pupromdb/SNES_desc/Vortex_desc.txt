Vortex (formerly known as Citadel) is a 3D shooter game developed by Argonaut Software and released by Electro Brain for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in September 1994. It is one of a few titles designed to use the Super FX GSU-1 enhancement chip.

The player pilots an experimental mech called the Vortex against the seven worlds of the Aki-Do Forces. The Vortex can transform between four different modes, fueling unconfirmed speculation that the concept may have been derived from an unreleased Transformers game.
