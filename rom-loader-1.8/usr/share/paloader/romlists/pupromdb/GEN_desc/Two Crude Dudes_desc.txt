After a nuclear explosion, New York needs rebuilding. This has barely started when the 'Big Valley' gang enters and takes full control themselves. The Government sends a pair of heavies known as the Crude Dudes in to clear them out.

Gameplay:

As with most platformers, players control the Two Crude Dudes (individually) by jumping, dodging and attacking their way through legions of enemies. Because the main characters are muscle-bound brawlers, they have the unique ability to pick up objects twice their own weight (ie: cars, traffic lights, stop signs, etc) and use said objects as weapons. While playing co-op, it is also possible for one player to pick up the other to use as a projectile too. Players heal in-real time by punching vending machines filled with 'Power Cola' upon which they must punch the machine in order for the soda cans to fall out, pick up the can and drink it (slowly) in order to heal.
