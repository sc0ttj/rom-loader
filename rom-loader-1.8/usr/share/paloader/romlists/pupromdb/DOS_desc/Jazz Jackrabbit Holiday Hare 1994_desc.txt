Starring everybody's favorite hare, Jazz Jackrabbit. Jazz must survive three areas of Holidaius using his own weapons to fight mongrels, monkeys, hands, ski turtles, and devils. 

The graphics have a "Christmas" theme to them and that means that the player will see snow, Christmas trees (with and without decorations), and red-and-white striped poles. Music has been changed, which is basically a remix of Christmas songs, including Jingle Bells, Deck the Halls, Rudolph, The Twelve Days of Christmas, and Silent Night.

Holiday Hare 1994 was released by Epic as freeware, and can be downloaded from the Internet.
