Ironsword - Wizards & Warriors II is the second video game in the Wizards and Warriors trilogy for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was developed by Zippo Games for Rare and first released in 1989 by Acclaim. The hero of the series, Kuros, must face off once again against the evil wizard Malkil, who has taken control of the four elementals of the worldwind, water, fire and earth.

Each of the four elemental realms consists of two stages. In the first stage, Kuros must find a golden artifact which belongs to the Animal King of the realm; once accomplished, the path to the second part of the realm will appear. In the second stage, the goal is to find the magic spell which can be used to fight the elemental boss. Without the spell, it is impossible to damage the boss. Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed, Kuros will pick up a piece of the legendary Iron Sword, which is needed for the final battle on Icefire Mountain.

A few new elements were introduced in this installment of the series. Gems and keys still exist, although the former are used for monetary purposes and the latter can be stored to open any chest Kuros comes across. Shops are located in each level, which sell weapons, food and magic spells. Kuros can also gamble in a game of chance at each shop, where the goal is to guess which cup a skull will land in. New to the series were magic spells which give Kuros special abilities for a limited period of time. Some spells can be used at any time, while others are only for specific situations.

Although the game is slightly easier than its predecessor, continues are now limited. The player can only rely on two continues, and cannot continue the game at any point after completing the Fire stage (the third of five major levels). Despite this, the game still includes a 12-letter password system.
