You are a new boxer trying to make it to the top. Can you do it?

Fight your way through four circuits of fighters. You get a limited number of rematches, so if you lose too many fights, it's Game Over! The game keeps records of scores and times for each fight. Compare your scores for each fight, or each circuit, and try to break all the records. See if you can beat your opponents in record time! There are tricks for beating each of the fighters super fast!

Directions:
Punch out your opponent! Use the Y and B buttons to punch your opponent, press up to aim your punches towards the head. Tap A when your meter is full to do a combo hit. Hold A to do a powerful Upper Cut.

Press left, right, or down to dodge attacks. If you don't press anything, you'll block low hits. If you hold up you'll block high hits. 

Controls:

A Button - Super Attack(requires meter to be full)
B Button - Right Jab
X Button - Nothing
Y Button - Left Jab
L Button - Nothing
R Button - Nothing
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Nothing

Tips:

Enter your name in Japanese
Highlight 'New Game' and press X + A.

Sound Test
When the Nintendo logo appears, hold the L + R buttons on Controller 2. Listen to the sound effects and music with Controller 1.

How to change the position of your challengers hands If you hold up until the ding of the bell, your challengers hands will be up and ready to block jabs.  If you do not hold anything, after the ding, your challengers hands will be down, ready to block body blows. This is useful if your trying to get a strategy to work. This works at the beginning of the fight and when they get up from knock-downs.
