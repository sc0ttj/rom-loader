In celebration of the release of Mega Man IX comes Rock Man Kenk. What is Kenk? It's a modified and polished version of Smart (RM 2 Dash) Apple's unfinished Rock Man Kai. 30% of the original patch was altered and fixed to keep the game's feeling in line of the original game. All the levels have been redesigned and boss fights and weaknesses have been altered. Keep in mind this patch only works on the Japanese Rock Man game.

The Mega Man series tend to be plagued with mods that are littered with cheap hits and unfocused level design. One thing that Kenk attempts to do is stick close enough to the source material in level style and difficulty, but at the same time it changes things up just enough to feel fresh.

It's one of those rare hacks that is meant to be played NES style rather than the savestate way.
