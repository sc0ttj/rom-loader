Rom hacks are always made with villainy on the mind. True, most rom hackers seek nothing more than to profane and disrupt, but there also exists a small collection of hackers that actually want to do... something with the original game. Some feel that the original Castlevania wasn't hard enough, and so they edit the levels to make it more challenging. Others will take characters and storylines (rarely both, but there are a few non-slacker hackers) and put them in a completely different game to create a pseudo-sequel.

These are all best case scenarios, however. In fact, I have recently discovered a middle ground between rom hack heaven and hell, a sort of rom hack limbo, where the author attempts to bring foreign characters into a different game, but ultimate creates only evil in the process. It is in this nightmarish place that I have glimpsed a hack of Mega Man 3 entitled "Tom Servo."

Now, of course, I don't need to tell you who Tom Servo is, or why anyone would want him in a game, but I will anyway for those of you who don't know, but are pretending that you do to avoid looking foolish in front of your friends - Tom Servo was one of the robots from the legendary TV experience known as Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K). Known for his gumball machine-like appearance and extensive underwear collection, it is only fitting that someone make a game with him as the main character, or rather, remake a game with him as the main character.
