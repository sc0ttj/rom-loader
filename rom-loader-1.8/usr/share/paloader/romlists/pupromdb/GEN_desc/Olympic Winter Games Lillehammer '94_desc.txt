Winter Olympic Games lets you realize your dream of participating in the 1994 Lillehammer Olympic Games as you compete in ten events: Biathlon, Speed Skating, Bobsleigh, Downhill, Ski Jump, Super G, Moguls, Luge, Giant Slalom, and Slalom. Since this is an officially licensed product, all of the events feature actual courses used in the 17th Winter Olympics. Game modes include Full Olympics, Mini Olympics, and Training, where you can practice any event as many times as needed. Choose to represent one of 16 countries and prepare yourself for the fanfare of opening ceremony. Up to four players can compete against each other or try to beat the Olympic Game Records. The 16-Meg Winter Olympic Games also supports the following eight languages: English, French, Spanish, Swedish, Italian, Portugese, German and Norwegian.
