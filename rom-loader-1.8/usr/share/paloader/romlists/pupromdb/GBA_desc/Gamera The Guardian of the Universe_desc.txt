This is a pretty interesting. It plays like a cross between a Vs. Fighter and a turn-based RPG. As is the code for any fighting game, battles are 1-on-1 and are determined on a best two-out-of-three basis. Pretty much it works like this: you hit a combination of buttons, and then watch Gamera perform whatever move you just did. It's kinda neet-o.

Translation Description:

All I have to say about the translation is ugh. Double ugh. Blibber got a great a deal of the text, but . . .UGH! I've seen better english in Godzilla movies than in this game. However, that's not entirely the fault of blibber, the text windows are tiny, and it is after all a Gameboy game? It's not like there's mounds of empty space that a quality translation would need.
