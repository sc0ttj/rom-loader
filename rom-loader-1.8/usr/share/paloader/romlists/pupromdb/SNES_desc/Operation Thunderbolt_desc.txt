This game is the sequel to Operation Wolf. Roy Adams and Hardy Jones, two green berets, must save American hostages from a hijacked airliner which was forced to land in the fictional African province, Kalubya. To do this, they must capture six different bases, shoot enemies such as soldiers, jeeps, tanks, and helicopters using your machine gun or grenade launcher, and try to save the hostages along the way. The enemies fire at you with bullets, grenades, or rockets, which must try to avoid. Once capturing the bases and achieving all objectives, the game will restart from the beginning and the difficulty will increase.

The Super NES version also works with the SNES Mouse and the Super Scope. In addition, the player was able to choose from a variety of different characters. The storyline was altered in that the hijackers were members of a fictional country known as the Bintazi People's Republic, ruled by General Abul Bazarre, ruler for life. General Bazarre demands that his comrades be freed or else the hostages will be executed.
