Enter the land of Xeen, a mythical place ruled by two villainous overlords. Solve many quests and puzzles as you attempt to unravel the secrets of the World of Xeen. This special version of the game is really two games (Clouds of Xeen and Darkside of Xeen) rolled into one, with two differences: One, your characters are able to travel from one game to the other, doubling the size of the world available for exploration. Two, CD-ROM technology has made possible the use of digitized speech in all places that call for it.
