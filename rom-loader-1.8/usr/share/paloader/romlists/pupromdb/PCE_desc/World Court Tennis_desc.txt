It's your serve. Wham -- the ball clears the net at 100 MPH and raises a little dust just inside the chalkline. An ace? No -- whop! Your opponent returns with a powerful backhand that kills your plan of charging the net. No matter how you play -- with up to three friend or against the computer, Singles, Doubles -- World Class Tennis will tax your endurance and test your skill with action that's fast and furious. Just don't scream at the line judge, he's never wrong!
