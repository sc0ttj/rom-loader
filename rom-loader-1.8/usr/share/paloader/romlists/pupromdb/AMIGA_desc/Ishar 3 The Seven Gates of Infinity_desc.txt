CHEATS:

Hold [Ctrl] + [Alt] + [V] while
the pointer completely to the left of the screen and press the
Left Mouse Button. 

Hint: Unlimited pendants and flasks:
When you pick up the flask and the pendant in a house,
click where the pendant and flask used to be. You can keep getting
both of them repeatedly. Try getting as many flasks as you can
carry. The extras can be sold for 15,000 each. Note: This only
works the first time when you get the items; you cannot go back
in and get more. Also, they may have to be picked up in a certain
order.
