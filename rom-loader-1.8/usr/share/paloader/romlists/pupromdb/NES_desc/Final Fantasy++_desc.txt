Hacked By - Silver X
@END
A full scale hack of Final Fantasy, nothing remains but the core programming routines. It features all new graphics, music, levels, enemies, text, statistics and more. Think of it as a "Total Conversion" for the NES.

After numerous releases, the hack has come to a state I consider final - All known bugs have been fixed and the gameplay has been polished to the best of my abilities. SRAM files from any versions other than 1.30 or Final will *not* work properly with this release. Sorry, too much has changed.

Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest role-playing game series known to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.

The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland.

Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system. The enemies wait until all of your party members have performed their moves, and the ATB (active-time battle) system is not used. You can buy weapons and rest in the towns, and the world map is populated by monsters, with which you will be engaged in random fights.

Before the game starts, you choose four characters from six different classes - Fighter, Thief, Blue Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes you choose for your character is entirely up to you. You also give the characters names.

Controls - 
A Button - Talk, make selection
B Button - Cancel, go back
Start Button - Show status screen
Select Button - Change order of marching

Hints - 
Hidden Puzzle Game
When you're on the ship, hold down the A button and press the B button 55 times to access the hidden puzzle game.

Extra Classes
The first 6 classes don't just stop there. Later on in the game, you get a secondary classes, which include Knight, Ninja, Master, White Wizard, Red Wizard, and Black Wizard.

This ROM hack is for those of you who already own Final Fantasy and found that it wasn't as polished as it could have been.

I have taken the liberty of "improving" upon this marvelous game, correcting as many of Nintendo's stylistic errors, graphical censorships, and mistranslations as possible. However, truth be told, Nintendo did a very good job translating Final Fantasy1. At least there were no "This guy are sick" lines. Even so, the script was rather bland and important words stuck out like a sore thumb (ORBS and LIGHT WARRIORS come to mind). By using a more optimized DTE scheme, decapitalizing 90% of the text (^_^) and streamlining the tile table (which took a lot of effort BTW!), I found that there was not only plenty of room for a full trannslation, but there was room for more! Since my Japanese skills aren't all that great yet, and since no one on the face of this planet would dare dream of translating the script for me, I decided that I would simply rewrtie the American script, putting my personal interpretive "spin" on it. The result is, I hope, a script that is more cohesive, entertaining, and logical than the original.

Please keep in mind that EXTENSIVE liberties were taken with the hack. Do not think that Nintendo cheated you out of all this information. I have heavily researched Final Fantasy I, and sought to expand on very minute, almost insignificant details. In essence, you are getting a condensed version of the story that will appear in Final Fantasy Silver.

FinalFacelift is a fun patch that changes the look, but none of the gameplay, of Final Fantasy for the NES. It's not a game itself, but only a patch file specifying minor changes.

That's a very modest description of this hack. Here's a short list of changes - 
- Five letter character names
- Default names for characters
- Retranslated names for items, equipment, and monsters
- Touched up dialog
- Enhanced graphics (With censored graphics restored)

It may not seem like a lot, but it has been the base for countless Final Fantasy hacks and offers an enhanced gameplay experience on its own.

Final Fantasy ++ (or Final Fantasy Double-Plus, or Final Fantasy Plus Plus) is a "re-imagining" of the very first Final Fantasy game.

What's been changed - 
+ Redone graphics. (Mostly ripped from later games in the series.)
+ Redone enemies. (Many are new; some are returning enemies with new properties.)
+ Redone magic spells. (Magic is now divided into White, Black, and Time Magic.)
+ Redone weapons and armor. (Some armors now increase evasion rather than lowering it!)
+ Redone maps. (Most are similar to the original game's; some are totally new.)
+ Redone character class system. (See Read Me.txt for details.)
+ Two new pieces of music. (Adapted from Final Fantasy 4.)
+ Some other relatively minor stuff.

This is a semi-sequel (or more like an expansion pack) for my previous hack, Final Fantasy ++ (so if you haven't played that, then you really shouldn't be playing this). At any rate, this is quite a bit harder to beat than FF++, so n00bs beware. Also, one can consider this sort of a tribute to classic SquareEnix (the way they were?). It includes adaptations of various dungeons from FFs 3, 4, 5, & 6, SaGa 2 (a.k.a. FF Legend 2), and Dragon Quest 5 (along with a couple of new ones by me). And, of course, lots of classic FF enemies are here for you to battle.

Another Omiverse production. This looks to be a very promising hack. Graphics replacement, text changed, characters changed, and items renamed. It even has some of the weapons renamed. Looks good all in all, characters say new things now.

This is actually a very nice and imaginative hack of FF1. Difficulty is increased, but not ridiculously. There are new layouts and such. A very nice job by one of ZMD's own.

What's been changed - 
- Fighter => Rydia

- Thief => Butz

- B. Belt => Lenna as the "Monk" class

- RedMage => Cecil, Paladin

- W. Mage => Plain Lenna with a cape

- B. Mage => Butz (I think) as the "Black Mage" class

- The class-changed characters are original creations, so they are not from any other game, however they may slightly resemble their former selves in most cases.

- The palette for the 16-24 character sprites (the ones you control in combat) has been changed to better colors.

- Hammers have been replace by whips.

- The starting values for chars have been grossly inflated to enable you to progress throught the game at a faster pace.

Hacked By - Kabucho
Version - Patch
@END
Kabucho informed us a week ago that he released a hack of Final Fantasy, called Quadruple Dragons. Quadruple Dragons is about four warriors that set out to revive the Four Orbs of the elements. You can choose from a Soldier, who is very strong in melee attacks, but is as dumb as a brick. The Bandit, who is very quick and is an average fighter. The Monk is very strong if you know how to use him. The Mage masters the art of black magic, while the Priest studies white magic. The Comic is useless... unless you get his character class up. In this game, all of the text, armor, weapons, magic, almost everything is changed from the original Final Fantasy. Even some of the towns and overworld map is changed.

WARNING - I got froze after saving the Princess in the beginning.  I don't know if this hack is beatable past that point.  ~Rx
