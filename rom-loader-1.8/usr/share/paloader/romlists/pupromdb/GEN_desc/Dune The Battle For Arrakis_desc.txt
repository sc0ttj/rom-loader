Dune: The Battle for Arrakis. Since this was my first RTS game, I didn't know what to expect. But after playing it for some time, I started to think how incredibly absorbing and challenging it is. There are a couple of problems, but only one of them is really annoying, and the others are tiny enough that it doesn't put a damper on the enjoyment factor. Hell, I'll go as far to say it's one of the Genesis' greatest titles.

Arrakis, it's a planet filled to the rim with spice. This spice can easily be converted into credits (currency), so it's no surprise people have taken interest in the planet. To be more specific, three Houses. They've had many negotiations with the Emperor of Arrakis, but all have failed. Grown impatient, they have decided to take the planet by force. It won't be easy, though, as each House have to fight against the others, and eventually, the Emperor, for dominance of the planet. Thus, the battle for Arrakis, commences.

Right at the start, you get to choose one of the three Houses to wage war with. The "fair and just" Atreides (after hearing the main storyline, though, that's just BS), the sneaky and deceptive Ordos, and the ruthless and brute Harkonnen. Each House has a varying difficulty level to them. Harkonnen being the easiest, as they start out strong early on and have one of the deadliest weapons in the game. Atreides being medium, their forces are pretty average when it comes to fighting, and the Ordos are the hardest to play with, they start out pretty weak and don't exactly have the strongest weaponry in the game.

Hints:

- better game. -
If you go to the password page and type in ''playtester'' you will not have to worry about your unit attacking the other houses and loseing units.
