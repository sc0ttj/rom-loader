ANHAK DRAKKHEN AGHNAHIR HURTHD!

The prophecy has been fulfilled. The world shall be ruled by the dragons. On an island far away, their lords prepare for the conquest of the lands. There is only one hope for mankind. The emperor sends out four heroes -- warriors and magicians -- to solve the puzzle of tears and prevent the invasion of the Drakkhen.

Drakkhen is an role-playing game with several ingenious features for its time. The eye-catcher is a mix of fast 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. Your party travels overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). Youll encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, youve got to find your way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Your party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.

Hints:

A good weapon for the mage and cleric is the bow. 

To enter Castle 2 use the unlock spell. 

To enter Castle 3, wait until the shark in the moat swims to the
right of the drawbridge, then cross. 

To get into Castle 4 wait until dawn. 

All armor, treasure and weapons inside palaces are restocked every
time you enter. Send the strongest character in to grab the
equipment, then distribute it amoung your band. If you need some
quick gold, do this repeatedly, then go see the weaponsmith.

Get all the expirence points you want by going to Prince Haagkens
castle.  Make your way past the bats, past the first fireplace with
the trap to the second fireplace.  In front of the fireplace is a
switch that activates a door two or three rooms farther on in the
castle when you step on it.  This door leads to a water fountain.
Looking into the fountain transports you to a room filled with
water that has a never ending supply of water monsters.  Take your
best weapon and armour with you. Set your character on 'auto kill'
and if he or she is able to hang in there, you can leave the
character in the room for several hours or all night killing off
zillions of monsters.  Do this for each of your characters and
you'll easily be able to kill the giant dragon.
