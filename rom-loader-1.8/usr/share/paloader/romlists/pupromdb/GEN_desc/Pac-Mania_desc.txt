Everyone's favorite yellow chomping circle of a being is back and upgraded in Pac-Mania. Just as in the 1980 classic, you control Pac-Man through a maze as he attempts to gobble up all of the onscreen pellets before a ghost captures him. 

As one might expect from a sequel released seven years after the original, there are several new features in Pac-Mania. Right away you'll notice that what once was a 2D maze with 2D characters is now 3D in both respects with a diagonal tilt. Also, you now have the ability to jump over the ghosts in your way, some of whom will tail you ruthlessly.

The cast of ghosts includes those from Pac-Man and 1982's Ms. Pac-Man -- Clyde, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Sue -- as well as Funky, a new character blessed with the ability to jump like Pac-Man. Instead of just four ghosts as in the orignial, expect up to six of them onscreen at once, each with his or her own personality.

If things get too hairy, keep in mind that each corner of the maze houses a power pellet that will enable you to turn the ghosts into your next tasty treat. Its effects only last a few seconds, though, so make the best of this time. Other delectable edibles include green power pellets (speed boost), red power pellets (double points) and fruit (extra points).

Once all pellets in a level are devoured, you'll move on to the next, harder one. But if you trust your skills, you have the option of starting as high in the game as round four.
