Home Alone 2 is a video game based on the 1992 movie Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, it was released on the NES, Sega Genesis, Game Boy, MS-DOS and Super NES systems. Though it is based on the movie in terms of plotline and additional dialogue, the game was different from the movie.

Certain changes made the game more interesting in an interactive game than in a static movie, such as use of different weapons and power-ups for protection, level layouts with enemies not seen in the movie, and for the Uncle's House level, usage of hidden keys and locked doors gained only after luring Marv or Harry into specific traps laid out in the various rooms (aka the first two Home Alone movies), as well as an active scene involving the Bird Woman and her birdseed attacks.

The Super NES version, while boasting a soundtrack with the Super NES' traditionally realistic sounding instrument synth, suffered due to slightly post-8-bit graphics and sound effects, as well as a disjointed feel of incontinuity between stages.

The Sega Genesis version, had no connection to the Super Nes, Gameboy, & the Nintendo Nes, it has a few levels missing such as the Plaza Hotel is not in the game and the Christmas tree finale battle is also not in the game.

Trivia:

- Home Alone 2: Lost in New York was awarded Worst Sequel of 1992 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.[1] They also awarded it Worst Movie-to-Game of 1993.
