Although a standalone game, Oh No! More Lemmings is basically an add-on to Lemmings. The game features 100 new levels, and all new graphics and music.

Trivia:

The original 6 tunes from the Amiga version of Oh No! More Lemmings were quite short, on other systems (Macintosh, DOS, Atari ST) the songs had parts added to them making them go almost a minute longer. For example, the original Amiga "Tune 5" goes for 46 secs while the Mac version's goes for 2 minutes and 5 seconds! Twice as long as the original. The song has a new Intro (0:00-0:12) before the original Amiga tune, which loops twice (0:12-1:25), then a new finish (1:25-2:05). Similar things are done to the other 5 songs.

As with Lemmings, the Amiga and Atari ST ports contained 10 special 2-player levels.

Oh No! More Lemmings was available either as a stand-alone game, or as a datadisk for Lemmings. The stand-alone version cost more. A Windows 95 version of Lemmings was released in 1995, including (nearly) all of the levels from Lemmings and Oh No! More Lemmings. The game was ported to the new OS by Visual Sciences.
