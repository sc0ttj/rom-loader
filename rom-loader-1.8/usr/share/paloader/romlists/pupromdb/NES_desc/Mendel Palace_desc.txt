Directions - 
This game takes place in an overhead view. In order to defeat a level of enemies, you must flip the tiles the baddies are under. How will this help? Only if you flip the tiles, and ram them into the walls will they be defeated! It will get harder as you advance, obviously! If you find special tiles, they can hold really cool stuff, so keep an eye out.

Controls - 
A Button - Flip block tile
B Button - Flip block tile

Hints -
