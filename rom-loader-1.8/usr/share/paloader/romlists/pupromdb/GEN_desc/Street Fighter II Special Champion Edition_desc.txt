Twelve fighters from across the globe have come together to face one another to see which of them has the strength, skill and courage to be crowned champion. Each fighter has mastered different skills and special moves, but it will take more than brute strength to defeat the others and earn the title of Grand Master.
--from the Street Fighter 2 Special Champion Edition game manual 

Gameplay:

Street Fighter II - Champion Edition, known in Japan as Street Fighter II Dash, was released on April 1992. It was the first of several updated versions of Street Fighter II (hence the Japanese title Street Fighter II Dash, a derivative of the original Street Fighter II). The four boss characters from the first edition became selectable characters and a feature was added that allowed two players to select the same character, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork was redrawn, as well and the stages' backgrounds were recolored. Much of the gameplay was revised to balance the characters out.
