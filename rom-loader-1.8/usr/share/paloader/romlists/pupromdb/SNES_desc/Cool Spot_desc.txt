Cool Spot was a low budget game, and was very short. There were only 10 levels and each level was about 5 minutes long. Total game-play was about an hour but a good game more or less. A good thing about it is it had photo realistic graphics and 5 bonus levels!! Cool Spot had some strange level designs, and this game also appeared on the Sega Genesis. The game had some great ideas on enemies they range from birds, crabs and some very strange ones later on. Cool Spot is a game everyone has to try at least once! (6/10 stars)
