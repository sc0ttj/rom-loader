Bad News Baseball has made-up players and teams. Note that this game has both a "boys mode" and a "girls mode", though you can hardly tell the difference (you can see the hair is a bit longer in girls mode). As the manual states " Unfortunately, in this mode, the zoom-up display shows only boy players. Sorry for letting you down.". You have to be a contortionist to get this mode, too.

Easter Eggs - 
The official code of Digital Press staffers - play with an all female team! To change all the rosters to girls' teams, hold Down/Left on controller 1 and Up on controller two, then hit Reset. The cursor at the main menu will change from a baseball into a heart.
