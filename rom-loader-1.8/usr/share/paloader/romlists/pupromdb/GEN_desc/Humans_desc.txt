"Just what the heck are HUMANS?... and what are they doing in a video game anyhow?" We know... we've heard it before, they're strange... they're ugly... they're stupid. But there's more to these HUMANS than meets the eye, for inside each and every one of them is a small but usable brain. Working as a team and discovering new tools is the key to survival in this cruel world of chaos and carnivores. It's an action-filled race against time, where you score points by finishing levels with as many of your tribesmen intact as HUMAN-ly possible (which isn't that easy when it comes down to survival of the fittest). With Gametek's Sega Genesis version of HUMANS, the only missing link is you!

Gameplay:

There are up to eight humans in a level, out of a possibly larger tribe. If a human dies, he is replaced by one from the tribe, if any are left. The amount of tribe members is set per game, not per level, thus it may be worthwhile to replay a level in order to get more humans through. If too few humans are left in the tribe, the game eventually ends as several levels require a minimum number of humans to be solved. Luckily, some levels have prisoners that you can rescue to add to your tribe.

The player controls one human at a time, and can switch back and forth. In many levels, the humans have equipment that they can pick up, use or throw.

- Abilities -

The basic ability of all humans is to form a stack by climbing onto each other's shoulders. This allows them to reach higher platforms, after accounting for wobbling. Flying pterodactyls can be used as transportation to get even higher.

The first item found is the spear. It can be brandished to keep enemy humans (or dinosaurs) at a distance, and can be thrown to kill such (which requires aiming similar to Scorched Earth games). However, the most important trait of the spear is using it to pole-vault over gaps (then throwing it back to let the next human vault over).

The second item is the torch, which is identical to a spear except that it cannot be used to pole-vault. However, some levels contain small bushes that are impassable, but can be burnt down with the torch.

The third item is the rope, which unsurprisingly can be used to climb down ledges.

The fourth and final item is the wheel, which is rather hazardous. It cannot be picked up, but a hapless human can mount the wheel and ride it. When rolling down an incline, this gathers enough speed to jump over large holes.

Some levels contain a shaman as part of the tribe. The shaman cannot use items, but can be used to conjure them after ritual sacrifice of a tribe member.
