Wow, this may be the most badass platform game ever. The game plays a lot like Prince of Persia, where you have to jump from platform to platform, do some climbing and essentially avoid falling to your death. There's also plenty of thugs trying to stop you, and collection of some of the toughest bosses I've ever encountered in a videogame. Meanwhile, Ninja Gaiden-esque cut-scenes tell the story in between levels. The graphics are almost on par with the TurboGrafx, and the control is amazingly fluid and dead-on. The more you play this, the more you'll say "damn, they did this on the NES?" It's just that kickass.

AWJ has outdone himself, in my opinion. The translation is excellent ... pretty near flawless. And that is one of the most ass-kicken-est font's I've ever seen in an Nes game, and that was quite a bit of work because the game's 8-16 is a pain in the bum to work with. Anyways, please check out this patch, it'll be worth your while!
