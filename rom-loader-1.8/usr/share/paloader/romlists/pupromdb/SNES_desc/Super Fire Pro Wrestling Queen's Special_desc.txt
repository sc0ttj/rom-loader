This translation along with many other wrestling translations, were originally hosted on two sites (www.firewrestling.com and the author's official homepage.) When both sites went offline, they took the files with them. Thankfully, using the archive.org search engine, this file along with many of the other translations were salvaged.

Out of all the translations, this game had a complete translation and it sure does look good.
