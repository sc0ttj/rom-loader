From the famous comic strip comes this multi-load action game. Flash has 3 distinct tasks to face, travelling through a desolate forest in the first, shooting or avoiding minions and avoiding the holes. The top half of the screen displays the action, while the bottom half displays a map.

The Cave of Barin is his target, with the aim of taking on Barin in combat using an array of punches and kicks. After this, Flash mounts a motorcycle and rides towards Ming, with guards to fend off and energy gates to pass through in order to replenish before finally taking Ming out.
