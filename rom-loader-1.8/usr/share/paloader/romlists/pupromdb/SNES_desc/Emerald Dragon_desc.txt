Okay, this is a different sort of RPG. It kinda falls into the same category as Star Ocean and Tales of Phantasia, or perhaps Radia - at least from what I can see - with a top-down, action-oriented system for fighting random battles. The graphics and cinematics are pretty, but I can't say much for the story due to my rather profound lack of Japanese knowledge, heh.

Translation Description:

This is the complete translation.

Nightcrawler has tested on real hardware to ensure it works. If you are unfamiliar with how to apply SNES patches, Nightcrawler has provided a Windows program to ensure the patch is applied correctly. For the rest of you, Nightcrawler has included a standard IPS. Also, be sure to check out the readme for some history on the translation.

The version 1.1 release fixed all reported issues to date (Nov 2008).
