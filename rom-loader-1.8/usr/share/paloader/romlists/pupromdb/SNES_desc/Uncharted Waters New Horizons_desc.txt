Known as Daikoukai Jidai II in Japan, this game is perhaps the most famous of the series. Even though an English version exists, it still has not managed to achieve the mainstream popularity Pirates! had. There is only a relatively small following outside of East Asia.

In this game, there are six protagonists to choose from, each of them representing a different path or career featured in the game.  While the game is more or less open-ended, developing the character's career is necessary to advance the plot.
