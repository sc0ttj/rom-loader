The object in the game is to defeat the Wicked Witch of the West that is trying to take Dorothy's ruby slippers so that Dorothy can return to Kansas.

Dorothy Gale travels to places like Shy Village (unnamed in the movie), Gamboge Gorge (a desert scene not used in the movie), Maize Meadow (possibly a reference to the corn field that the Scarecrow can be found in the film), Saffron Fields, Xanith Farms, Citron City (not used in the film), The Red Country (not used in the film), and Cinnibar City (yet again, something that is not present in the movie).

Then it veers off into other stages that are exclusive to the video game version (except for the Emerald City and the poppy fields (where the Wicked Witch tried to poison Dorothy and crew to sleep in the movie}, that was in the film version also, and is the original point of the story to get to the Emerald City).
