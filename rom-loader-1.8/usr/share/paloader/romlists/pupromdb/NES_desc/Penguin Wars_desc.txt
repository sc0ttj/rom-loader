This is one of those games where there isn't actually a real game ... just a bunch of mini-games. Kinda like Mario Party. You're this penguin, and you compete in various competitions, like a Air Hockey/Dodgeball thing, Whack-A-Mole, and others. I couldn't get past the Air Hockey thing though, because I totally suck at this game. It's infuriatingly difficult.

Translation Description - 
May. 18th 2007 Addendum - Spinner 8's Addendum Patch was released May 12, 2007 and fixes the problems listed below about the game messing up in most emulators. This is an unofficial addendum patch. It should be applied on top of an already patched ROM.

The title screen is in english, and the engrish text has been fixed. They could at least have made a GOOD title screen, but who are we to complain.
