"Wayne Gretzky Hockey may be the closest you will ever get to playing professional ice hockey without actually being on the ice. Fast-paced skating, sudden scoring, hard checking, and penalties are all part of the game. You'll be an important member of your team. And whatever position you play, you'll have to play it well if you want your team to win."
