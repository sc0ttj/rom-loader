Something evil is lurking below the city of Waterdeep. The Lords of Waterdeep summon a group of heroes to investigate. But someone or something has been watching the proceedings. After the heroes enter the sewers, the ceiling collapses behind them. The only way out is the way down, into a dungeon filled with monsters, traps and puzzles.

Eye of the Beholder is a dungeon crawler RPG with a first-person perspective based on the 2nd Edition AD&D rules. Your starting party consists of four characters and up to two NPCs can join later. Combat and magic happen in real time. Fight over a dozen different monster varieties and cast over 40 spells. A point-and-click interface makes exploring, fighting, spellcasting and handling objects easy.

CHEATS:

Safe exploring:
Copy disk two and create your party on both disks.
Begin game play and insert the disk two copy before any secret
doors are discovered or doors are unlocked. This forces the game
to write the current status to the backup disk. Replace the original
disk and continue game play. If the party becomes stuck and the
game must be restarted, continue with the backup disk to have
all doors previously locked opened and have a surplus of keys
after they are collected.
