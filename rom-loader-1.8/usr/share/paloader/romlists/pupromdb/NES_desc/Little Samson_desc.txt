You're Little Samson, a brave young mountaineer, and you're about to embark on the most important journey of your life. The Imperial Forgy has been attacked by Ta-Keed, the Prince of Darkness, and you're the only one who can stop him. Along with the owners of the Magic Bells, you'll venture through a vast world filled with evil creatures and dangerous beasts. But you have the ability to turn into several different forms - Kikira the Dragon Lord, Gamm the Rock Lord, and K.O. the mouse. Take advantage of the special powers each form possesses, and you should have no problems saving Imperial Forgy and defeating Ta-Keed.

You'll also be able to collect power-ups that are scattered throughout the world, which will make you even more powerful. Everyone is counting on you, Little Samson, so gather up your courage and get ready.
