Youre local town is the scruffiest for miles around, and its about time it was cleaned up.  Armed with nothing more than your trusty bike and skateboard, you set about collecting as much as possible as fast as possible.  Unfortunately, the townsfolk dont share your enthusiasm, and although they wont try to stop you, they do tend to get in the way.  Then theres the holes in the road, the kerbs, the cones, the ramps.....loads of obstacles stand between you and your goal, and theyre not doing you or your equipment any good.  Theres money lying around just waiting to be collected thought, and performing stunts will also improve your bank balance.  Collect enough, and itll give you the chance to visit the shop and upgrade your skateboard or bike, or to carry out essential repairs.

You have just one life, and the game will end when you run out of energy.  You will then be given the option to start a fresh game on the level you ended the game on with the same amount of money and energy as you began that level.

There are six progressively difficult areas to be cleaned up, starting with the fairly straightforward street, and ending on the dangerous and difficult boardwalk.  Prove that youre up to the challenge of these mean streets, and youll get the chance to really test your skill in the ultimate challenge, against two other ultra skillful opponents.
Theres nothing to collect or do, just race to be the first to cross the finishing line.  This race has the biggest rewards up for grabs, but the hazards and narrow mean track mean that its gonna require split second timing, ultra accurate jumps and spins, and loads of speed to finish top.  Are you ready to prove youve got the gutz for SKIDZ????
