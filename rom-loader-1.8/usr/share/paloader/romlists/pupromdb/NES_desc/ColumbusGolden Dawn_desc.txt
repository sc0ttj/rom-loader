It's... a role playing game! Set in what I can only assume to be the time period of Columbus! Due to my limited knowledge of Japanese, that's about all I know about the game. Oh, and the combat is really weird, like Lunar, only you take a step and your turn ends. You've got to admit it's clever, so maybe one day this will be translated, or something. Yeah.
