64 Trump Collection: Alice no Waku Waku Trump World (64??????????~????????????????~ translates to 64 Trump Collection - Alice's Exciting Trip to Trump World?) is a card game based on Alice in Wonderland for the Nintendo 64. It was released in 1998 in Japan only.
[edit] Critical Reception

The game was not received well in English speaking territories. United Kingdom based N64 Magazine (now NGC Magazine) described the game as "an unfathomable Alice in Wonderland-themed card game" which was deemed "nose-achingly pungent" and "a real Lenny Bennett of a game". The magazine rated the game at 21%
