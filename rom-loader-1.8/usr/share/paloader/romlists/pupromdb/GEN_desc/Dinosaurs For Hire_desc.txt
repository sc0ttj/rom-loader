Basically the game is broken into different sections (likes issues in comic books) and they all have their own plot, The first one is destroying a robot minotaur that is disrupting the cable broadcast from the Empire State Building and irritating the subscribers (probably the best plot ever) and the second one involves you fighting the monster form the fake intro (though he is much harder now). Now these might not be the epic plot of Contra were you have to defeat an evil alien threat to save the earth from destruction but then again the Dinosaurs for Hire was never a comic to be taken serious.

First off let me say that this game is hard and I mean hard like Contra Hard Corps hard (I'm extremely serious) I would recommend a game genie with almost invincibility (wears off around the final few stages) to help through some of those really hard levels (like part B of stage 2) . Now you can play as any one of the 3 Dinosaurs (I know their were four in the comic) Archie (T-Rex) who is fast but has the lowest strength, Lorenzo (Triceratops) the middle man, and Reese (Stegosaurus) the slow moving heavy hitting tank. Once selecting your character of preference (Reese) you are greeted to a scene of a dinosaur like creature with magma for blood climbing up a dam and after a few seconds you are throw directly into action. After you blow his arm and leg off the credits begin to roll (Not Kidding) but then Cyrano appears saying that their has been a malfunction with your genesis's blast processing unit (epic reference) which is a joke and the real game starts.
