The Living Daylights is a side-scrolling action game which features eight levels of gameplay, centered around the Timothy Dalton movie of the same name. Beginning with a "training" mission in Gibraltar, Bond then assists General Koskov's defection to the West, rescues a Bond girl, fights off henchmen, and takes on an evil weapons dealer.

Bond can run, duck, jump and use weapons created by Q (including the Ghetto Blaster) and take out enemies with his trusted Walther PPK.
