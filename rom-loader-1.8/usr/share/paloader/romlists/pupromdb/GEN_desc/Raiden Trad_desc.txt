In the year 2090, Earth is invaded by extra-terrestrials. The World Alliance of Nations has developed a supersonic attack fighter, Raiden, to defend the Earth. A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them.

Gameplay:

The formula of the game is simple and typical for the era of this game. The player pilots the "Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter" through waves of enemies, and several levels. There are two types of weapons, and the player can collect several powerups for them to make them stronger. There are bombs and missile powerups as well as collectable medals which add to the score.

- Fighter -

Raiden fighter always starts with vulcan main weapon.

When player dies, the fighter drops items, based on the former fighter's weapon powers.

- Weapons -

    - Main weapon. There are 8 weapon levels:

        - Vulcan: Fires wide formation shots (max 7 directions).

        - Laser: Fires forward-concentrating shots.

    - Sub weapon. There are 4 weapon levels:

        - Homing Missile: Fires enemy chasing missiles.

        - Nuclear Missile: Fires forward-concentrating missiles. When it hits an enemy, the blast persists for a short period.

    - Bomb: Destroys bullets on screen, and damages enemies in the blast area. There is a moment of delay between pressing bomb button and explosion.

When a player's fighter shoots the other player's fighter, the attacker's projectiles transform into 'stars' that radiates from the attacked fighter.

When player dies, the fighter's fragments become projectiles that damage enemies.
