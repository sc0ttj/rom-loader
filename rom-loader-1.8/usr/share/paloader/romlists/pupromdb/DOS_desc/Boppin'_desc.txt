A group of do gooders, set on making the video game galaxy pure of evil, entrap all the villains of video games in picture patterns and it's up to the Boppin brothers to save them by matching all the pictures together, and destroying the blocks. 

Trivia:

Boppin' was originally an extremely obscure Amiga game. The original game is a lot shorter (less levels), but has better music and sounds. No other differences (that I know of) are present between the two versions.
