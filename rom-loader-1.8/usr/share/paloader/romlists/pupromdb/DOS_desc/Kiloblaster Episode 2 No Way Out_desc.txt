New-age Galaxian. Move along in space in your fighter and shoot anything that moves, while collecting power-ups, such as fruits (fruits in space?) and thing, which looks like red circle with yellow "T" inside. Like other games from Epic, it's shareware and only the first episode is free. You have to pay for two other episodes. This game has joystick, Sound Blaster and VGA support.
