Fry up the track on long straightaways, or downshift into neck-wrenching hairpin curves. Super Monaco GP sends you screaming around the most demanding tracks on earth in the hottest racecar ever built, the Formula 1. Choose your car's transmission. Slide through a practice run with an automatic, battle rival drivers with a 4-speed, or grind gears to victory piloting a 7-speed machine. Super Monaco GP's World Championship sends you and your pit crew on a 16-race international circuit. Burn rubber with the best drivers around in a piston-pounding test of speed, road savvy, and endurance!

Gameplay:

Super Monaco GP is a modified conversion of the arcade game, a first-person perspective racing game. As well as the famous Monaco course, others from around the world have been added, to give the game a longer shelf life. You must complete qualification sessions and the races as fast as possible.

The Genesis version of Super Monaco adds a complete career mode, however. In the career mode, your goal is to win a season of races. Unfortunately, you start with a relatively slow car. By challenging other drivers, you can move to a better team and car, and ultimately win the F1 World Title.

Hints:

- Lose Your Head! - 
In arcade mode, cross the finish line in the top three while pressing A,B and C. When your driver holds aloft his trophy, he holds up his head instead!
