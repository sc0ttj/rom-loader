Terrorism has reached new heights. AATOM (Atomic Age Terrorist Organization of Miracali) has constructed their own nuclear power plant, and threaten the world with atomic terror.

The world powers have decided to initiate operation THUNDERCADE to stop AATOM. Equipped with a high-preformance combat motorcycle, sidecar cannons, and backed by a precision B-7 bomber, you set out on the dangerous mission. The wind rages through your hair as your cycle charges into enemy territory. Your sidecar cannons unleash a storm of hot metal rounds, shredding tank armor and shattering concrete. When the going gets rough, you call in air support and let the flyboys wipe'em out. Through city streets, forests, and strongholds you fight, but can you make it to the fortress and save the world?
