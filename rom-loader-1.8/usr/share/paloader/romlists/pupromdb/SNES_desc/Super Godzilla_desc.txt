Unlike other games of the era, Super Godzilla is not a straight action game. Instead, the player must guide Godzilla into the different levels by pressing the adequate button in the appropriate place. The game is split in two screens: the top one shows the actions Godzilla is making at the moment, while the bottom one shows his location on the current level. When Godzilla finds a monster to battle, the game switches into a standard side-view fighting segment.

This game is known for having Bagan, a monster that was originally supposed to fight Godzilla in a feature film. The game is also known for substituting the original Mechagodzilla for the Heisei Mechagodzilla in the American version of the game because Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II had not been released in American at the time.

Story:

Invading aliens have now approached Earth, threatening all life. The fate of the world lies in the hands in a small group of people, who enlist the aid of the mutant dinosaur Godzilla. Controlling the King of the Monsters through a transmitter on the Super X II, players must lead Godzilla through several cities to fight a final boss that awaits at the end of each level.

Tips:

Skip Current Level
At the title screen, press A, A, B, B, X, X, Y, Y. This will activate the level skip cheat. Then at any point during a level, press L + R to skip to the next level.
