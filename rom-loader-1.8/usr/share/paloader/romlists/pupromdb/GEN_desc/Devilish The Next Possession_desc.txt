There was a once a happy time when princes and princesses could get together and take the 'live happily ever after' route without being accosted by devil-faced demons with names like ¬I. Back when kids respected their elders and you could leave your house without locking the door, such couples had no fear from monstrosities with names that look like an ASCII hiccup randomly showing up and turning them into stone paddles.

But those days have passed, and the unfortunate young couple in our tale fall foul to such a demoralising fate. Cursed to spend the rest of their lives looking like a slightly more solid version of Pong's infamous paddles (but with sex-identifying colour coding!), hope was lost. From the demon world came the chuckling of ¬I, but from the heavens fell a solitary blue orb. The blue orb of hope and rapture!
