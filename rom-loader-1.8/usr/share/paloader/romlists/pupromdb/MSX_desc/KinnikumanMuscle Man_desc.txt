"Kinnikuman Colosseum Deathmatch" is a game based on the manga/anime franchise Kinnikuman, better known in the West as Muscleman. It's also the first video game to ever appear based on these series, and as you could expect, its genre is fighting. A single player must fight past three opponents, after which the game loops. Matches consist of a unique round, health is measured with a energy bar, Up jumps, down ducks, and you can attack from those positions or while standing, and execute a throw (it's also one of the earliest games which allows this). You also count with a risky technique where you jump against the wall, tap the direction towards the wall, and tap attack, making your character bounce off the wall; damaging your opponent if the move connects, or hitting the ground and damaging yourself if it doesn't.
