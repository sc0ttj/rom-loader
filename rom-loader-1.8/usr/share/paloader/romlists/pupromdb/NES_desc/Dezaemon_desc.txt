This is a pretty interesting game. You can use it to pretty much create your own scrolling shooter game. It's pretty simple - you go in and create a title screen, soome enemy and player sprites using a fairly simple editor, then design your map and place the enemies. It was probably one of the first "Make your own ... "-type-game. You should also note that it comes with a pre-made game, however it is insanely difficult!
