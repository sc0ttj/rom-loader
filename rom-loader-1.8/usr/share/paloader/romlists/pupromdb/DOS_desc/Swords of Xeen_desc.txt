After you finally defeated Lord Xeen in Might and Magic 4+5 (World of Xeen) among the ruins of Greyhaven you find a magic pyramid that seems to be the gateway to a new world. Nothing is known about the gate except that Xeen used it a lot, and thus the Dragon Pharoh sends you out to see what threat lies on the other side.

The gate leads to Havec, a new world filled with new creatures and dangers for Might and Magic veterans in this, a high-level, stand-alone scenario that continues your adventures in the World of Xeen saga with the same engine and gameplay mechanics. 

Trivia:

While Swords of Xeen began as Catware's fan modification of Might and Magic: Darkside of Xeen (and hence contains no new visual or sound assets not found in that earlier game), its eventual endorsement and publication by Xeen overlords New World propel it out of fangame territory, if not exactly into Might and Magic canon 8)
