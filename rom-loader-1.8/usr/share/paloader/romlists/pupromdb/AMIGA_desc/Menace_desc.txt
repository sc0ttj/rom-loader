The speech in the introductory sequence probably sums things up best - "the biggest unanswered question is 'where is the money?'". You have 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade your craft. Your energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal from you, rather than physically doing damage.

The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires you to duck through gaps in scenery.

Six ruthless dictators have collaborated to create the planet Draconia, which contains some of the most gruesome and harmful life-forms imaginable, all indulging in some rather unsavoury actions. Thus, you must go in your spaceship to destroy them all.

The game is a side-scrolling R-Type-influenced shoot 'em up consisting of six visually-diverse levels. Waves of enemies come towards you to be shot, and reveal tokens, which when shot at will cycle through several available weapons. These include lasers, cannons, improved ship power and a shield.
