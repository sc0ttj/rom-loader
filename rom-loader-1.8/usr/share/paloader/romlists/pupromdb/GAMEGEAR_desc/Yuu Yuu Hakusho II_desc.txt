This game is kinda strange. Its like a One-on-One fighter? However, it doesnt take place in real time. You basically enter your commands (which are pretty either punches or special moves), then the game decides what the opponent is going to do, and decides the outcome. Unfortunately, its a very easy game, so dont expect to be captivated for too long.
