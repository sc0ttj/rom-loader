Fans of Solomon's Key would like Pyramid Magic. It sports the same "find the key and leave" gameplay that made Tecmo's classic so addictive. It's also as bare bones as can be. The plot is a single screen long (and that presumably includes gameplay instructions as well), but once you begin playing, no help is needed. Use rocks to get over tall obstacles and to hunch down low enough to pass through small spaces, and jump on the two chests to gather the colored keys needed to access the final exit talisman. There's a ton of levels, and though your bonus is time-based, there's no limit. One word of caution though: there's only a single way out of each room, and you have to be very careful about which rocks you decide to break. Simple yet addictive fun.
