You've managed to get yourself a job delivering newspapers for the Daily Sun. You have to get papers to all your subscribers without running out, and hopefully without breaking their windows. If you fail, you'll end up looking in the Sun for a new job. If you do well, you could end up in the paper for your amazing accomplishments!

Paberboy 2 includes more houses, more obstacles, more enemies, and a lot more options! You can use your expert aim not only to deliver the news, but also to make the neighborhood a better place to live. So grab your bike, warm up the old throwing arm, and get out there!
