The second and last game in the Worlds of Ultima series saw the hero going off to Mars at the turn of the century. An intriguing combination that made for a very interesting game similar to Space: 1889. Chat with characters of 19th century history like Freud, Tesla, and Mark Twain, and try to solve the problems of the ancient civilization that left its mark on Mars as your spacecraft crash lands after taking off from the 1893 World's Exhibition in Chicago.

Trivia:

Under a rock near the southern pole are a familiar looking pair of ruby slippers which, when clicked together three times, sends you to a unique end-game screen accessible only via this Easter Egg.
