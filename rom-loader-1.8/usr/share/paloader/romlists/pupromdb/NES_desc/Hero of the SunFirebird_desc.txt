This is supposedly based on some kind of anime show in Japan. I've never seen it before, but you're sure I'm going to now, after seeing all the oddball characters in this game. As you can see, it's a nice little shooter game. Well it's not great, but it's decent enough. It's really slow though, so don't expect to get totally overwhelmed like in R-Type or something, like that's a bad thing. You're lucky if you see two enemies on the screen at the same time! But still, it's a neat game. My roommate and I both agree that the Professor is its saving grace. He is just too damned cool!

Translation Description - 
This new patch version 1.01 by Dragoon-X translates a lot more stuff, giving this a true 100% completion mark. There's still some weird color changes in the text sometimes, though they were there in the original rom. Why didn't the programmers mess with that? Oh well.
