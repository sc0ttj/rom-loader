If you've played Kero Kero Keroppi's Great Big Adventure 2, you know exactly what to expect. You shoot things at enemies, and you play some kind of funky game with the boss, instead of actually fighting him. The word chain game is freaking DIFFICULT. Anyway, the most major change (not really a "change," since Wagyan Land came first) is that you can't jump on your enemies to kill them. You can't even kill them at all, unless you get four powerups and become invincible. Once you shoot an enemy, it's just FROZEN for a little while, and you can jump on it and stuff. It's pretty wicked. And of course, one hit kills you, just like in all great games. Too bad the collision detection totally bites. Oh yeah, and the graphics are awesome! They're just so simplified and elite and stuff. So yeah! Play the game.
