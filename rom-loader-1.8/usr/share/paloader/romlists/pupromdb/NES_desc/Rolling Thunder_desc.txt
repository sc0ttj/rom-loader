Rolling Thunder - The name of the world's most powerful secret police force. You - It's best agent. But there's more. The enemy has captured beautiful agent Leila and is even now torturing her. You - and you alone - can save her. She can't hold out forever, so you better move fast! Armed with a handgun, you run and jump through treacherous passageways, blowing away enemy thugs. You can enter marked doors to collect bullets or special weapons like machine guns. The deeper you go, the more deadly the enemy becomes. This time, it's not just an action-packed game that tests your reflexes to the max. This time, it's personal!
