Metal Warriors is about the United government in the year 2102 being under siege from Dark Axis led by the leader Venkar Amon. The few remaining warriors defending Earth would be known as the Metal Warriors.

After successfully completing a few missions in space: rescuing a scientist, gathering intelligence, defending a ship and capturing a mining facility, the United government disables a anti-spacecraft canon in the Colorado mountains in order to safely begin removing axis forces from earth. Missions on Earth include assaulting a facility in the jungle, fighting through bombed out cities and capturing deep-earth mining facilities. Finally, the player confronts Amon and defeats him in a battle between fully mobile flying armored suits.

Gameplay: 

Much of the game mechanics fall inline with a platform game. On top of the regular single player game, the addition of a 2 player split screen mode did add value to the title. Most notably each selectable robot has their own melee weapons in the game.

The gameplay mechanics and level design are very similar to Assault Suits Valken/Cybernator, but this game is not a sequel to Cybernator as many users tend to believe. Cybernator and Metal Warriors are completely different games made by different companies.The confusion comes from the fact of Konami being the publisher of both games for the US.

The game notably made use of each of the Super Nintendo's buttons: The D-Pad would move the player's mech, L would activate power-ups, Select would eject the pilot/enter a mech, Start paused the game, R would activate defenses, Y was the basic ranged weapon, A was the melee weapon, B was movement, and X was tied to a unique ability. (This was not the case for the Drache.)
