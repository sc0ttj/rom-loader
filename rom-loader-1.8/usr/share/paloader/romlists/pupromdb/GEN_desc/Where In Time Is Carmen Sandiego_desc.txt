Carmen Sandiego and her gang are loose once again, and it is your job to capture her! This time round you not only have to find where she is, but also when she is. Traveling to various locations, you need to assemble clues by questioning witnesses and searching locations to close in and capture Carmen Sandiego. Included with the game is The New America Desk Encyclopedia to help make clues more meaningful (and act as a form of copy protection!).
