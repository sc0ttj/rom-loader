The Mighty Beanz have all been scrambled up, and it's up to you to put them back together correctly. You must swap and combine pieces of the Beanz together to successfully match their upper and lower halves to make them whole again. The more you match, the more Mighty Beanz points you score. Battle the Majesco Gamer Beanz Team to unlock Rare Beanz, and trade them with your friends through the Game Boy Advance Link Cable.
