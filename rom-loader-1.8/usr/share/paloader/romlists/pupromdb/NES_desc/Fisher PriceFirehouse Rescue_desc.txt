A fire has broken out in someone's home. Now you must take control of the FISHER-PRICE FIREHOUSE RESCUE crew to save the people trapped inside. Get into the truck, navigate the maze-like city, and stop at the blinking house. Once you arrive at the house, you will need to get the people out of the building by letting climb down the fire ladder. After you rescue the people and their pets, head back to the station and wait for the next emergency.

If the game becomes too easy, you can change to one of the three other difficulty settings. Work your way from firefighter to chief in FISHER-PRICE FIREHOUSE RESCUE., A fire has broken out in someone's home.
