The Dragon Ball Z fighting game that started it all, as they say. After this game, Bandai realized that fighting games are where it's at, and that no one wants to play crappy card-based RPGs anymore. And I hear that the recent Budokai PS2 games are actually good, unlike this game.

Translation Description:

Everything is translated except the opening and ending. Kay?

Tips:

Extra Characters
At the intro screen, when you hear Goku talking, hold the L and R button and rotate the D-pad and the four buttons [A, B, X, Y] in a circular manner.  Repeat this until you hear a chime and Goku's voice again.
