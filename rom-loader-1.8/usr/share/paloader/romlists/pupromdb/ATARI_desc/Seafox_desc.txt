Excitement and danger under the sea!  From the depths of the ocean in a lone submarine, you try to destroy a convy of enemy ships and its escort while staying alive amidst exploding depth charges, mines and torpedos.  Superior maneuvering ability, courage and an aquatic ally are your only hope for survival in the battle.
