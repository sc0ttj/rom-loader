In the educational title Wacky Worlds Creativity Studio, players use any combination of 40 stickers to place animating objects into any of 6 wacky world environments. Stickers include Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Ecco the Dolphin, and many other SEGA characters. Then the players paint objects in any color they like.
