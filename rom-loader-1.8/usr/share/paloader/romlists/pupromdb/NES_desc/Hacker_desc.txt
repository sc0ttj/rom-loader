I found a whole treasure trove of cool China pirate games including names like Final Fantasy VII, Chrono Trigger, Harvest Moon, Diablo and a Zelda game among about 50 others that I couldn't make the names out!

Man was I excited to try them out.

But then....

iNES Mapper 163 struck down my hopes of ever seeing these played on XPORT's Madmab Edition on the Box!!!!!!!! 

One game did work though....

The Hacker!

Title screen is pretty awesome.  It looks like you're going to play Neo from The Matrix. (Why does he have a pony tail though?)

The game pretty much blows and doesn't respond well to your controls, but put the controller down for a minute and there are some impressive animations your character does while waiting for you to move.

All in all.... skip it.


NOTE -  If you do decide to give this one a try it may take a few times getting it loading.  Sometimes it just kicks you back out to the menu.
