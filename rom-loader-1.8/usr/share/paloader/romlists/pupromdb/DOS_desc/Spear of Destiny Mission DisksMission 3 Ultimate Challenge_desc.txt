An expansion disk released both in standalone floppy version, and bundled with the original Spear of Destiny in the Spear of Destiny Super CD pack. This is the final set of missions being Spear of Destiny mission 1 and so on...

This add-on ends the Spear of destiny storyline as you continue through 21 new levels based on Hitler's new atomic research laboratory. Includes better sounds and graphics as well as new enemy sprites, and some minor adjustments like for instance the inclusion of crushed rats as indicators of secret doors, new prizes to get, etc.

Also included are printed floor maps to every level.

Note that this mission disk was neither developed nor produced by id, and was just a licensed cash-in.
