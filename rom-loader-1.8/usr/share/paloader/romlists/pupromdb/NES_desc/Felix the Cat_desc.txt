The game involves the player controlling Felix the Cat to defeat the evil mad professor who has kidnapped Kitty, Felix's girlfriend.

Game Mechanics - 
Felix the Cat has simple game mechanics. The A button is used to jump (press repeatedly to fly or swim), and the B button is used to attack. The type of attack varies depending on the magic level. When Felix falls into the bottomless pit (past the bottom of the level) or when the game clock runs to zero, he loses a life regardless of what his magic level is.

Magic Power and Common Items - 
At the upper-left corner of the screen, there is an indicator (using hearts) for how much magic power Felix has available. The magic power deplenishes by one every six seconds. It is replenished by milk jars (2 hearts per jar), hearts and F-icons (full recovery). Hearts, from the Felix head emblems, increase the magic power level by one. Depending on the type of exploration involved, there could be anywhere from one to three higher levels than the base. If another heart is collected when at the highest level, an extra life is awarded along with full recovery. The F-icons give full recovery as well as an extra life. Higher magic power levels bestow increased attack power, range, and speed, making it easier to defeat enemies. If Felix runs out of hearts on the indicator, the magic power level is reduced by one, and the heart indicator is reset to 10.

Enemies - 
Felix the Cat has enemies with simple behaviors, but a large number of them. Some include moles, tree trunks, cannons, birds, fish, and even 8 boss monsters. Bullets and anything fired have two routes - a straight line or an arc that goes through the ground. Enemies generally walk horizontally at a constant speed back and forth, bounce up and down for flying enemies, or shoot something--the most complex follow Felix at a slow speed. If Felix takes a hit, his magic power goes down one level; if Felix is at the lowest magic power, he loses a life.
