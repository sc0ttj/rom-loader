If you are a fan of the Superman Comic books you will love how well the followed the storyline of Superman's demise and resurrection. The only real drawback I can see in the fun factor is the repetitive battle system. Some times it seems like the baddies just aren't going to quit. Some of them are tough too. The Punks on the Harleys are a real pain. They are hard to knock off even with flying capabilities.

You use multiple characters through out the game. Super Man himself, The Cyborg Superman, The Last Son of Krypton, Super Boy, and the Man of Steel are all playable characters within the game. The bosses will give you a good challenge in this one. Especially the the last level boss.
