Saint Seiya franchise is probably one of the most well known (and long-playing) both in Japan and in the West, containing several manga tomes, animations and games. This one is the end of the so called "Gold Cloths Period" in Seiya's timeline and as I can guess - this is also continuation of the obscure RPG game released on NES a bit earlier.
