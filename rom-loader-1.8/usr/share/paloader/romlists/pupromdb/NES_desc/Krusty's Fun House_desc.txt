Everybody's favorite alcoholic clown from the hit animated TV show THE SIMPSONS makes his way to the NES with KRUSTY'S FUN HOUSE. It's infested with purple rats and Krusty needs your help to exterminate the little vermin. While Bart and Homer man the rat traps, it's up to you to herd them into the traps, where they'll be taken care of.

Of course, the rats have friends that will stop at nothing to make sure you are unsuccessful snakes, aliens, and flying pigs will all be out to get you, so you'd better be smart and fast if you're going to survive. You've got Krusty's custard pies at your disposal, and while they may not taste good, they do make excellent weapons! Head into the Fun House and get rid of those nasty rats in KRUSTY'S FUN HOUSE.
