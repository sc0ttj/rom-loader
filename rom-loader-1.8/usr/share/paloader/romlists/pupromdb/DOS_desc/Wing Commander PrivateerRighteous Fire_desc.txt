A little-seen add-on disk for the original Wing Commander: Privateer, it added a new plot line with the religious zealot "Retros" out for conquest, along with more weapons and goodies to buy for your ship. It was also included in the full talkie Privateer CD-ROM.

Trivia:

Along with my (European) copy of Righteous Fire, there came a Strike Commander poster, which says "Strike really flies with an Intel486(tm) DX2." On the back side of it there's "What does an Intel486 DX2 do for you?" with several examples, including Strike Commander, Michael Jordan In Flight(tm), Star Trek: 25th Anniversary, Syndicate and Ultima Underworld. The last quote is on the bottom of the back side, saying "Intel486 DX2. Can you survive without one?"
