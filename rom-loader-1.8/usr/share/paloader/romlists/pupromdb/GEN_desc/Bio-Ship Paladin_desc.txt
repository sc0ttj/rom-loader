Bio-Ship Paladin succeeds where many others have failed; it breathes innovation into a crumbling genre. What makes the game even more special is that the gimmick it relies on never burdens the game, but serves only to highlight the fact that within lies everything you can expect from a competent shooter: you scroll, you shot, you dodge. It's happy to give you all that, and then it smugly offers you even more.
