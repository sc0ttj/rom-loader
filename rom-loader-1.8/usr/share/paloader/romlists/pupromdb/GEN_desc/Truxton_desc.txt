Power on! All systems go! Takeoff! Meet the alien attack head-on in your Super Fighter! Before the Gidans overrun your planet, destroy them in an explosive scramble in space. You are the one pilot alive with the guts to do it! The Gidans have blown up your planet's cargo barge and are on their way to Borogo with a swarm of flying fortresses - asteroids loaded with tanks, guns, and explosives for an all-points takeover! Attack them face-to-face in your Super Fighter, the most powerful assault ship in the universe. Blast them to kingdom come with Power Shots. Fire the incredible Truxton Beam to disintegrate their speeding onslaught. And when there's no escape through their force fields, surprise them with the devastating Rainbow Circle Shot! Take on the Gidans in 5 separate battles of space carnage. You CAN save the planet!

Hints:

- Stage Select -
Tap Up, Down (x4), Right (x8), Left (x16) during the title screen. You will hear an explosive to confirm. Press the Start button to go to the level select.

- Super Bomb -
You must have at least one bomb. When you come to a boss/enemy detonate the bomb and instantly pause the game, so the explosion wih the skull is on the screen. Leave it paused for about 15 seconds, and when you unpause, they will be destroyed.
