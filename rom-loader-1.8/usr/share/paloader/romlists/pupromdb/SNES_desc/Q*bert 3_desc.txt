Q Bert 3 is an awesome game. It's just like the first one, except the graphics and sound are better. The levels are a lot cooler, too. Q Bert was huge when it first came out, but after a while the buzz about it just kinda died down. It's still an awesome game. The controls on this version weren't the same as they were on the NES. If you are used to playing the NES version, this one will take some getting used to. Q Bert 3 is an awesome game, so give it a try!
