It is the first chapter in the Elder Scrolls series and it is huge. There are over 400 cities, towns and villages to explore, tons of magical items and heaps of spells to create.

The CD-ROM release featured speech in cutscenes and additional rendered sequences that the floppy version did not include.

To coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Elder Scrolls series in 2004, Bethesda Softworks released the first game, Arena, as freeware. It can be downloaded from the Elder Scrolls website

The Elder Scrolls: Arena was primarily inspired by a collection of pen and paper RPGs, the Ultima Underworld series, and the first-person RPG Legends of Valour.
