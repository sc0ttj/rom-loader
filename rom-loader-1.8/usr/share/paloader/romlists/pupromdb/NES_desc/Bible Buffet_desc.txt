This video board game uses a thick book of Bible questions included with the game for certain sections. You can play well enough without it, however.

Gameplay - 
The object of the game is to get rid of the food that tries to kill you. The weapons available to players are oil drums (whose exploding method emulates the mechanics from the Bomberman series[citation needed]); forks, knives, and spoons. The game also includes a quiz section where players answer three True/False questions in order to advance. These questions would be the only Bible references in the entire game, but they are only found in the game's instruction manual.
