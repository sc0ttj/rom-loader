No one in peaceful Alurea was ready when the Monsters attacked! Mobs of grimy creatures swarmed over the land. Only the Chiki Chiki Boys survived.

Can these twin princes win back their country from the nasty gnarlies of Monster Palace? Strike out with your sword against Spiky Furballs and Bashing Beansters. Throw Magic Orbs that explode with awesome energy! Snorkel underwater, battling Snapping Sharks and Chicken-Crabs. Fly and fight through gangs of Angel Fiends and Horned Imps. At the end of every world, punch out a huge Monster Menace like the Two-Headed Turtle Dragon! And save the Kingdom!
