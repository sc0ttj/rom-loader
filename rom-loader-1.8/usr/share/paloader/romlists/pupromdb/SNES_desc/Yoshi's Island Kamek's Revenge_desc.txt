Features: 

-54 or whatever brand spanking new levels, ranging from easy difficulty to pretty damn hard difficulty. 

-Lengthly levels, ranging from 5 minutes to half an hour (there are plenty of mid-rings, but you can use save states I guess if you get stuck badly) 

-The first Yoshi's Island hack to ever have ExGFX, so to speak. All the level icons are edited, and most sprites have slight GFX edits. 

-Some slightly tweaked music, but again, that's another thing I lost motivation on. 

-And more stuff which I don't remember.
