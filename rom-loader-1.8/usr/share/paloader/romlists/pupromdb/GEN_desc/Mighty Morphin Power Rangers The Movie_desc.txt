The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! 

This game plays much like the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers game for the Super Nintendo. In other words, it is very nice. The graphics are great, good quality for the Genesis. The sounds and music are nice. Music from the TV Show is used when playing through different stages. The game-play is superb as well, fighting various enemies and giving you a good time to keep you going for a while. Give this a try if you're a fan of Power Rangers or platform games.

In this game, you play through six stages of karate-kickin', mighty morphin' action! In the beginning, you can pick the ranger of your choice... 

There are six ones you can play as. Tommy the White Ranger, Rocky the Red Ranger, Adam the Black Ranger, Billy the Blue Ranger, Kimberly the Pink Ranger, and Aisha, the Yellow Ranger.
