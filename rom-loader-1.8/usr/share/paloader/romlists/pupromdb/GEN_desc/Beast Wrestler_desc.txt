This story is placed in the 21st century, and is about genetic engineering. This genetic engineering has caused scientists to develop specific life forms called 'the dragon warrior'.

These dragon warriors have been breeded by many trainers, and these trainers have a goal to be the world champion, in the Dragon Warrior tournament. Someone please back me up on the story, because I'm not sure if this is it. The reason I gave it a 7 because the background of the story is unique, but the same concept of the 'tournament of the world' is kinda old. But, it seems like it would make a good anime of some sort.
