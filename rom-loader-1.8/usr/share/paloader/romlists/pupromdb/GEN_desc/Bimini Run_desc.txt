"Kenji Ohara! The evil Dr. Orca's henchmen have kidnapped your sister,Kim. You and your loyal friend, Luka, must pursue and capture the kidnappers before they can return to Dr. Orca's impenetrable island hideout."

As you start, the enemy boat will be fleeing to the right and will direct itself towards the masses of sailboats. You'll get a call on your radio, so pick it up to learn that you'll need to use stun gas to fire at them at short range. The boat will make a path of chaos as it rams into other boats, but since it clears them out of the way, you only need to follow behind it and use it when you accelerate enough to close in. Helicopters will appear on the horizon, but you have an unlimited supply of ammo, so just hold down the button as you cruise. When you finally close in enough to use the stun gas on the kidnappers you'll finish the mission.
