This is an alternative patch to the standard translation. What's different, you may ask?

For one, you always have a map, and the maps have things such as the exits marked for you.

Also, both Up and Down exits alert you to their presence - This was one of the most aggravating things about the original game.

And finally, you take half damage; this makes things a lot more fair.

So basically, this is a big step towards what the game should've been like in the first place.
