This is an extensive improvement hack that seriously tries to take the 'wasted potential' the author saw in the game and bring it to life to make the game more appealing to all. This was accomplished mainly by balancing all aspects of the gameplay.

This patch is based on Neo Demiforce's FF2j translation.

The following are just SOME of the changes that were made. (See the Readme for the rest) - 
- Changed font
- Revised difficulty ramp to be more balanced
- Spells were made to be much strong and some were renamed
- Complete overhaul of monster stats
- Weapon system was revised to be more balanced and more appealing
