In this jet fighter simulation, fly multiple missions with varying skill levels, including both Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground missions. Explosive aerial combat action as you intercept enemy aircraft or "take out" strategic ground targets -- missile sites, bunkers, airfields and buildings. View all the action in "first-person" perspective from the cockpit of your F-16 Falcon.
