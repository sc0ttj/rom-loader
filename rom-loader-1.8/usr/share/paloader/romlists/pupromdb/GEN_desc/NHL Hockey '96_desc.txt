Electronic Arts continues its popular hockey series with NHL 96 while including several new enhancements to gameplay. Improved computer intelligence, new player moves, five-minute major penalties for fighting, and multiple difficulty levels are the title's main new additions. Exhibition, playoff, season, and shootout modes are all here and players can still create and trade players, maintain user records, deal with player injuries, and view instant replays. NHL 96 makes full use of NHL and NHLPA licensing to ensure a realistic playing experience.
