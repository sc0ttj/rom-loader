So you thought you'd seen the last of Sludge Vohaul? Think again! Like every evil scientist is supposed to, Vohaul returns with an even meaner scheme. This time he intends to infest the planet Xenon with thousands of genetically engineered door-to-door life insurance salesmen. The last thing he wants is you, ace-janitor Roger Wilco, messing things up and so you are captured and brought to the planet Labion to spend the rest of your days working in Vohaul's mines. Fortunately the shuttle that takes you to the mines crashes and you're the only survivor.

Can you survive the dangers of the jungle planet Labion?
Can you stop the evil Sludge Vohaul?

Space Quest 2: Vohaul's Revenge is the second game in Sierra's humorous Space Quest series of adventure games. It's a classic adventure game with a text-parser: you move Roger Wilco around with arrow keys, and interact with the world by typing commands. As in every Space Quest game, there are lots of ways to die. 

Trivia:

For some unexplained reason, Sludge Vohaul's name has mysteriously changed from Slash Vohaul in the first game. (It's not really known why - maybe Sierra thought "Slash" could be taken to sound a little rude for a family game?) Either way, it would remain as Sludge Vohaul for the rest of the series.

Sludge Vohual is of course a spoof of Darth Vader from Star Wars, and the monkey guards are a spoof of Planet of the Apes.

When you select About SQ2 from the Sierra menu after you die, you'll get a message that says 

We hope you're not looking for someone to blame just because you died rather than the usual message.
