Well, if you're into RPGs with a lot of plot, you might want to stay away from this game. There's a menu at the beginning, and you can choose from 50 scenarios. When you choose, you go right into battle. It's that simple. No messy plot to clutter things up or anything like that. It's too bad, a plot would really be handy, because maybe it would actually explain things a little. The game's kind of easy at first, but that's because you can just use the LONG skill and hit the Emperor twice and then kill him. Then you win. Pretty simple eh? Well I don't much like strategy RPGs anyway, so I admit I didn't give this game very much of a chance. Sorry.

Translation Description - 
Due to this game having zero storyline, translating this game was probably very easy. I mean, all you have are menus and stats, right? Well there you go. Anyway, it's complete, so have fun with it.
