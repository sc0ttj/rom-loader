Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Fighting Edition is a Super NES fighting game that is based on the television series Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. In this game, the Power Rangers themselves are unplayable as fighters; instead, the Zords and monsters are used for the game.

The engine for the game was later reused for another Natsume game, New Mobile Report Gundam Wing: Endless Duel.
