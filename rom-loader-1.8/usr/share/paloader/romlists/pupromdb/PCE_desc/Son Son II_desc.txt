All things considered, SonSon 2 is a surprisingly fun game. I don't know why I didn't think it would be fun, maybe I thought it was gonna be a shooter or something. Well in any case, it's a side-scroller. You're a little monkey thing and you run around with a pole. It's a really long pole, so that makes it more fun. Now that I think about it, the game's a lot like Wonderboy in Monster Land, in the sense that you run around in various areas and buy stuff and you only have one life, at least I think you do. Maybe you get continues, but I couldn't get past the first stage. Yeah, I suck. Well SonSon 2's a lot more fun, since you have a lot better control over your character than in Wonderboy in Monster Land. Why am I comparing it to Wonderboy in Monster Land? Augh.
