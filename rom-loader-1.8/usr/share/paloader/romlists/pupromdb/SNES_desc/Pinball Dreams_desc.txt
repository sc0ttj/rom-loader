Its four tables each had a theme, as do most real life pinball machines. Although Nightmare was nominally the most difficult, it usually gave out the highest scores of all due to bonuses such as double score. The version of Pinball Dreams bundled with the Amiga 1200 had a bug which rendered most of Beat Box's advanced features non-functional.

 - Ignition, themed around a rocket launch, planets, and space exploration.
     - The Expert Software Pinball 2000 port of the game renamed this table Rocket.
 
 - Steel Wheel, themed around steam trains and the Old West.
     - This table borrowed its design from the "Bad Cats" pinball machine.
 
 - Beat Box, themed around the music industry, charts, bands and tours.
 
 - Nightmare, themed around a graveyard, ghosts, demons, nightmares and generally evil things.
     - This table borrowed its design from the "Terminator 2: Judgement Day" pinball machine.
     - Unlike the other tables in the game, the name of the table in the menu did not reflect the name displayed on the table itselfGraveyard. Some ports of the game (notably the GameTek port to the Game Boy) name this table "Graveyard" in the menu as well.
