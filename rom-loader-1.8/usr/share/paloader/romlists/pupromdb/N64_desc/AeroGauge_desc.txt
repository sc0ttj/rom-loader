AeroGauge is a futuristic hovercraft racing game for the Nintendo 64 released in 1998 (1997 in Japan).

Ascii's AeroGauge runs basically along the same conceptual lines of play as Psygnosis' Wipeout or Acclaim's Extreme G. The main difference is that the vehicles in the game fly instead of staying a few meters over the track, so it's possible to maneuver them in the air (unlike the previously mentioned games).
