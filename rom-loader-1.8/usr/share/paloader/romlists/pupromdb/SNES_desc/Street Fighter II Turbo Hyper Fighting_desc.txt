THE TOURNAMENT BEGINS

Twelve fighters from across the globe have come together to face one another to see which of them has the strength, skill and courage to be crowned champion. Each fighter has mastered different skills and special moves, but it will take more than brute strength to defeat the others and earn the title of Grand Master.

--From the SNES Street Fighter 2 Turbo instruction manual.

Overview:

Street Fighter 2 Turbo is almost just like Street Fighter 2. The only difference is, you can adjust the speed of the game-play.

Game Posters and Extra Ending
Finish a one player game against the computer at level 8 difficulty without continuing.

After the normal ending, instead of the characters battling credits you normally get for defeating the game at level 6 or higher, you get a sequence for each character, similar to the character stats at the game menu screen, using a move to destroy a crate.

Once the credits have rolled, a poster will appear on the screen. For Turbo it is a group shot of all eight player characters, for Normal (Champion Edition) it is a picture or Ryu and M. Bison.

Skip 1-Player Matches
Not really a cheat but a useful trick none thr less. begin a 1 player game as usual but during the game press start on controller two so that player two joins in , choose player 2's character , say for example Ryu , and then defeat him.

Once the two player game ends you will be taken back to the one-player tournament , now the character you defeated during the two player round will be checked off and you will not have to fight him in tournament mode.

Using this trick the only character you will have to beat to complete the game is M. bison.

View Character Profiles
Turn on the game and wait until you see the first profile of a fighter. On Controller 2, hold the L and R Buttons for as long as you would like to look at the profiles.
