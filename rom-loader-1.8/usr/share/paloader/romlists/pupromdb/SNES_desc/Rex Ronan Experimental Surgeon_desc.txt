Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System game that teaches players about the hazards of smoking tobacco cigarettes. The player goes inside a man (named Jake Westboro); he is dying of lung cancer while undergoing emergency surgery. He has a wife, a kid, a house in the suburbs, and a job with the Blackburn Tobacco Company that he had since he was 15 years old. Now the man is dying from the cigarettes that he once sold; the player must go inside of his body and defeat the evil tar and nicotine that is preventing the man from speaking to the world about the hazards of tobacco. If the player dies from the robots sent by the tobacco company, so does the patient.
