This is a graphical hack of Mega Man.

Mega Man takes on a more futuristic look, and his much-lampooned jump animation has been changed. Many of the minor enemies look different, and Ice Man is somewhat more menacing.

Beyond that, the game is exactly the same. Any FCEU movies recorded with the original Mega Man ROM will work exactly the same under Mega Man Alpha.
