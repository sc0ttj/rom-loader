A meteor struck the Earth, and caused great chaos. Seven gods from ancient times awoke, and are now attempting to take control of the post-apocalyptic world.

Primal Rage is a one-on-one fighting game featuring dinosaurs and giant apes as the fighters. The graphics are done with digitized stop-motion animation. Gameplay is similar to Mortal Kombat in that it is viewed from a side perspective, and features deadly finishing moves at the end of the match.

Trivia:

There was going to be a sequel Primal Rage 2 but due to poor sales it got cancelled. However Atari felt it need a sequel in one form or another so the book written John Vornholt called Primal Rage: The Avatars was made instead of a second game.
