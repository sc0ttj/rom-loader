Story - 
Kid Klown and his family are on their way to perform in a circus when they meet the magician Night Mayor. He asks Kid Klown to help him open a treasure vault, but Kid Klown, having been warned about the evil magician by his parents, refuses. Not willing to give up so easily, Night Mayor kidnaps Kid Klown's family and dares him to follow him into his world if he ever wants to see his family again.

Gameplay - 
The player character, Kid Klown, carries balloons with which he can attack, jump higher, or float. There are seven (including the introduction level) different-themed levels throughout the game, and at every end of the level is a bonus stage where he can collect extra lives and extra energy.
