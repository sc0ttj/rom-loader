Monster Rancher BattleCard GB combines traditional overhead-view RPG gameplay with a complete Collectible Card Game. Players familiar with other Monster Rancher games will recognize characters and places, but no prior Ranching experience is needed to play the game.

You explore a secluded island village and the caves nearby, battling opponents in card games. As you progress, defeated opponents will add to your collection of cards and items.
