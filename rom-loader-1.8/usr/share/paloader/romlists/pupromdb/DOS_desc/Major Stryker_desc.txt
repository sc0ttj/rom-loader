Major Stryker is another of Apogee's attempts to make a commercial-level shareware game. It's a rather typical shoot-'em-up vertical scroller with EGA graphics.

Trivia:

The first real appearance of the familiar "Apogee theme song" was in the game Major Stryker.

The hero, Harrison Stryker, is related to Duke Nukem, another character from Apogee games.
