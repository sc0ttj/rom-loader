While the title might suggest a sports game, this is in fact a platform game - the goal was to guide a little soccer player boy through various levels, using his soccer ball as the main tool. The player was able to perform runs, shots, bicycle kicks, headers and other sorts of soccer moves to either advance in the level or eliminate enemies.
