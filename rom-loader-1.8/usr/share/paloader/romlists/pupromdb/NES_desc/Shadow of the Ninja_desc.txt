The year is 2026, and things have apparently changed in the good old U.S. of A. As one of two "Shadow Ninjas," or both if you play together with a friend, your job is to liberate New York City from the evil Emperor Garuda.

Pretty good graphis, and decent music. Overall a worthwhile game, so give it a spin!

Directions - Side scrolling beat-em-up, anyone? This one's pretty good, I must say. Not too simple, not too complicated, not too thumb-defyingly hard. Lots of different enemies that don't make you feel like you're just fighting different pictures that are really all the same. You can pick up different weapons that change the power and range of your attacks. There are throwing stars, a morning star on a chain, and you can get up to three swords which become stronger and reach farther.

Summon Lightning
Hold down B for a few seconds to summon lighting bolts to kill all enemies on the screen. However, this takes away about half of your life.
