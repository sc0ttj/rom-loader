This is a pretty large change of Mega Man 2. The main features include altered levels (altered both color wise and structure wise), altered colors (different enemy palettes, a altered sprites, and even a different storyline. Gamers should find the hack more challenging than the original Mega Man 2.

The game is basically Bass being the hero and Dr. Light as the enemy.
