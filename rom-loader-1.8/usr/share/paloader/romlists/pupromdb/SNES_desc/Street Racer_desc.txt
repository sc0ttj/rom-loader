The game features the ability to race the Street Racer Championship, beginning with the Bronze Championship and moving on to the Silver Championship, Gold Championship and Platinum Championship. Each championship gave you, after winning, a new password which could be entered on the Options Screen in order to unlock new tracks. The winner of the championship would be the driver with the most points after every race has been completed. Points are awarded according to the final positioning of each race, with bonus points awarded to the driver with the most punches, the most stars collected, the fastest lap, a record lap and drivers who lapped other drivers. The Championship could be raced in Championship, Head-to-head or Practice mode.

The game also featured the ability to choose the tracks for a Custom Championship, to drive a head-to-head series with a CPU driver, and to drive individual practice races. There was also a racing game called "Rumble", the objective being to knock the drivers out of a ring. It could be played in 3 levels of difficulty. Also, a "Soccer" mode (not in the Playstation version) featured a field to play against all other characters, with a giant soccer ball and a single goal for all. The score wasn't of team play though.

For all modes of play, whether Championship, Custom Championship, Rumble, or Soccer, Street Racer allowed the setting of many of the game parameters.
