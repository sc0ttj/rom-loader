Being a parody of the original Final Fight, the game's premise is exactly the same as the original Final Fight. Mike Haggar's daughter is kidnapped by the Mad Gear gang, leading her father, along with Cody and Guy on a rescue mission to save her. However, the story is depicted in a much more comical fashion than the original game. The gang kidnaps Jessica, not to manipulate Haggar, but rather because their leader Belger is infatuated with her and that he wants to marry her while taking over the city from within the process.

Gameplay - 
Much like the SNES version of Final Fight, the game does not offer any cooperative game modes and is strictly a single player affair. However, unlike that version, Cody, Haggar and Guy are all playable. Each character has virtually all his techniques from the arcade version (esp. the life-depleting death blows). The extra feat is that once Experience Level 4 is reached, each character may perform a hidden technique performed by simultaneously pressing Forward + Attack. These new techniques have Cody's chi blast, Guy's dual kicks, and Haggar's body splash. Each character also has his signature weapon of preference, found within rolling drums. Such weapons are - Cody's knife, Guy's shuriken, and Haggar's mallet.

Players earn experience points by killing thugs to boost their levels like an RPG. Level-ups during battle heal a player's health to 100%. Subsequently, the player's HP, offense, defense, and speed increases, enabling him to survive longer and learn the coveted hidden potential powers. Stronger characters increase their level more slowly than others. Points can also be earned by picking food when in full health aside from goon-bashing. At the Maximum Level (6), the player can inflict very large amounts of damage with even the simplest combo.

The cute super-deformed child-like sprites and brilliantly colorful backgrounds can be visually compared with those in River City Ransom, as well as those in the NES port of Double Dragon II.
