Gameplay

Big Mountain 2000 puts the player in control of a racer using either snowboard or skis. There are three different modes to choose from: time attack, multi-player (two players maximum) and championship. The player can design custom gear, including equipment, and clothing.

As the player advances through the game, experience is gained and new levels can be unlocked. Instant replay allows the player to watch an older run-through on a level. The player is given a stamina meter with longer time intervals between falling and getting up each time the racer falls over. There are six characters of wildly varying skill levels to choose from.

Development

The game was released in Japan under the title Snow Speeder in 1998 almost two years before its North American release.
