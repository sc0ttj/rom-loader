An arcade beat 'em up, Street Smart puts you in the shoes of the ass-kicking "Karate Man" who decides to deliver a can of whup-ass to the reigning gang bangers in town.

Gameplay:

The gameplay resembles other fighting games like Double Dragon where the player can move in all eight directions in an arena fight and the player can kick, punch or do special moves. The player can choose to fight as "Karate-Man", a martial arts expert with lightning quick moves, or "Wrestler" (sometimes known as "Crusher"[citation needed]) with a powerful punch. Unlike most side-scrolling fighters, the players fight in an enclosed arena space,If two players are present, they can take on the enemy together but will always have a "Grudge Match" in the next round to determine who gets a bonus life/points. The two players can play through the entire game together.
