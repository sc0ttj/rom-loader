Based on 1990 Apex Computer Productions/Thalamus C64/128 release.

Creatures relied on 'cutesy' graphics interspersed with very bloody 'torture screens' where between each level a single screen puzzle was presented to the player, who had to solve it (often in highly humorous fashion) or run out of time and lose the game, together with a very bloody end for the recipient of the torture.

The CREATURES acronym stands for Clyde Radcliffe Exterminates All The Unfriendly Replusive Earth-ridden Slime.

Game designed by Apex Computer Productions.

Game contents contained a large A3 size CREATURES poster.

A Spectrum conversion was planned, but never released.

The sequel CREATURES 2: TORTURE TROUBLE was released on the C64/128 in 1992, but didn't appear on the Amiga (or any other platform) despite a planned conversion by WJS Design [Source: Amiga Power preview (Oct 92, p46), courtesy of the Amiga Magazine Rack (AMR)].

N.B. A Spectrum conversion was planned, but never released.
