As promised, we are releasing the ROM for Hoppin' Mad for everyone to enjoy, free of charge, now that we have sold out of our copies of the game.  If you haven't had the chance to check it out yet, please do.  There isn't another game like it on the console, and although people find it to be unforgiving in it's difficulty at times, I find it to be quite fun.

Thanks to everyone who bought copies to help fund further projects, we're already starting on the next release and we couldn't have done it without any of you!!!

Enjoy the game, and please let us know what you think.
