Well, this is a fighting game. It's based on an anime. Not beingthe anime fanboy I once was, I am no longer blinded when playing a crappy video game just because it has an anime license.

This game is pretty horrible. It's SLOW. Aren't fighting games supposed to be full of high-speed action? Shouldn't Chun Li be flying around the screen faster than your eye can register? She should. But no, in Mobile Gundam yadayada, we are stuck with mechas that move like Betty White with a case of rickets.

There's hardly any variety in special moves; just the usual assortment of Street Fighter rip-offs, just much less cool-looking than their Capcom-inspired counterparts. Oh! And in story mode there's only like five playable characters.

Anyway, on a scale from Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle to Street Fighter II Turbo, I give this game a solid rank of Tough E Nuff.

Translation Description:

GIdeon took this game on as an exercise in changing font widths, and as this patch demonstrates, he was successful. The translation for the story mode text was handled quite well by Alexander Beetle, and should be an enjoyable to read. Unfortunately, if you made it this far down the page, you've already read my game review, and know that is a really horrible game. So, you may never see those keen translations.

Tips:

Use Devil Gundam
At the Character Select Screen, highlight any Gundam, then hold L + R+Select + Start and press A.

Using God Gundam in Story Mode
Pick Shining Gundam as your fighter in Story Mode, then lose a couple of times (as in the whole fight, not just a round in a fight), and God Gundam will automatically replace Shining Gundam as your character.
