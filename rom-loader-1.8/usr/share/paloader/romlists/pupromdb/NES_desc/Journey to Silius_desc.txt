The time is the year 0373 in the new space age calendar. The earth's population is exploding so rapidly that people are seeking exodus to an outer space paradise. People everywhere are eager to develop space colonies and emigrate to them.

Jay McCray is no exception. He is preparing for his journey to the new space colony #428 in the Silius Solar System. He decided to move to the colony because his father, an astute scientist, was instrumental in the space colony development. Jay had always been proud of his father and wanted to be like him, even more so now, becuase his father was appointed leader of the SSS colony development.

Jay's dream is to be on a space colony development team. Unfortunately, his dream will not come true. A devastating explosion rocked the SSS colony and destroyed everything, including all project data and the research team. Any further development of the colony would be impossible.

Because Jay's father was killed in the explosion, Jay would never know what really happened. He is determined to take over for his father, but without his father's records, research is at a standstill.

While searching his father's room, Jay finds a floppy disk. When he puts it in the computer, he realizes, it contains a complete plan of the SSS colony development. The disk also includes a letter from his father which reads, "Terrorists are plotting to destroy the colony development. If anything happens to me, you must complete the project."

"Father knew this would hapen," Jay said to himself, "but, now that I have his plans, I can finish his work." As Jay worked on the project, he realized the terrorists were still out there and even more determined to destroy the SSS colony plan.

Jay then vows, "I have no choice but to fight the terrorists to defend the colony development and to avenge my father's death."
