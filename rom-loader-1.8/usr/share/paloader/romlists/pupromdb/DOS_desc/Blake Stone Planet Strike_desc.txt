The commercial sequel to Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold. New features include new enemies, new weapons, and new new levels.

Trivia:

Although the developers claimed to have created "all new aliens and guards" for Planet Strike, if you really look closely you can see that the "new" guards are really just the original three guards, recolored a bit to look more alien-like.

A lot of the "new enemy sounds" in Planet Strike were the same sounds that existed in Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, just played backwards.
