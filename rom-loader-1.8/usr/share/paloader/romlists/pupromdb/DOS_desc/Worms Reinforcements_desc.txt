Reinforcements is an add-on to the original Worms game. It includes some welcomed addition to gameplay, like the ability to choose the worm you want to use each turn, new levels and multiplayer support. It also allows the creation and the use of custom levels and speech packs. You will never look at your worms the same way after you give them the voice of Sylvester Stallone...
