A long time ago, a ghostly White Lion attacked Maria's village. A hero appeared and drove the lion away. But Maria's parents wanted to find out where the Lion came from and what its purpose was. They set out on a journey, and never returned.

One day, Maria decides to go look for them. As she begins her journey, a bridge gives way beneath her, and she is washed away by a strong river current. She awakens in a strange new world...and must find her way home, while looking for her lost parents and the mysterious White Lion.
