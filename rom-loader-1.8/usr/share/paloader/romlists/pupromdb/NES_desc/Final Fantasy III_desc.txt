I can not say enough good things about this game. I love it. A lot. I didn't think I would, but look what happened! Yeah, so this game is a hell of a lot better than the first two Final Fantasy games, in almost all respects - vastly improved graphics (on par with those of FF4), a kickass soundtrack (including the coolest boss music EVER).. Basically it's just a helluva fun game. Think FF5 with less plot. When you win a battle you get Capacity points, and you can use those to change Jobs. Whenever you get to a Crystal you have get more Jobs that you can use, and, uh, stuff. This is probably my favorite Final Fantasy game out there (except for possibly FF7, but we won't get into that), and is definitely one of the best 8-bit games I have ever played. It starts out kinda rough, but once you get past the beginning, it's great. Really.

Translation Description - 
This is a wonderful, well-done, professional translation. The only problem I have with it is.. Ah hell, I'm just kidding, I just can't think of things to say here. It's really great, let's just leave it at that.

In this basic ROM hack almost all of the text is changed from the original Final Fantasy III to make funny statements and remarks about the scenarios that the good guys encounter throughout the game.
