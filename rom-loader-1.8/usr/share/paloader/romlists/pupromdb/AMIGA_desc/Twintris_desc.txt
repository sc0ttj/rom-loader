Excellent Tetris clone. It has six modes of gameplay for one or two players which progress through the difficulty levels and the player does not get bored with doing all the same all the time. Add to this tournament and cup modes and you get ultimate tetris which you can only dream about! Handling is smooth, graphics are OK, music is awesome. Nothing more, nothing less.

An essential game. The best Amiga (or any other machine) Tetris clone for its smooth piece movements, excellent musics, and some unique level and gameplay features, like the "earthquake effect" when making multiple lines in one move (than can disturb to your opponent in 2 player mode).
