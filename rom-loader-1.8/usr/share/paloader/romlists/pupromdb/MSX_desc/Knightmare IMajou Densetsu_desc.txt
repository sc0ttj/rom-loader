The game is about brave knight, who shoots with arrows all his enemies and at the end of level their bosses such like witches, etc. Shooting monsters, avoiding obstacles, passing the bridges and collecting upgrades for your weapon leads you to the glory. Digitized music and sound adds more to ordinary arcade gameplay.

This game maybe also about two brave knights (you and your friend) who does the same for the victory on one screen.
