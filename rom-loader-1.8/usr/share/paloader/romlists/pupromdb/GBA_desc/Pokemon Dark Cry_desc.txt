You have finished your adventure in Shinou. But you're looking for an new adventure. Wat you don't know is that the safari zone had pokemon from Shinou. But they have escaped and have been spread to whole the region. Team Rocket has got Mewtwo in their hands again. Mewtwo was feeling ill and let team rocket capture himself. Team Rocket did, so they gave meewtwo an armor. After that he escaped again. So you must capture him.
