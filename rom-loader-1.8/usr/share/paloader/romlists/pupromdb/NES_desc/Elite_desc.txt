You have a ship with virtually no equipment. Take her and trade among the different star systems. You can be safe and trade on razor-thin margins among the safe systems, or take some risks and trade with anarchic systems while watching out for pirates. You can save on fuel costs by buying a fuel scoop and fly near the sun, but again, watch out for pirates! Or be a pirate yourself and raid other ships... Don't get a bad rep as the police will come after you... Dock with space stations and do your trades (some may take contraband...) Upgrade your ship with your proceeds with better weapons, shields, and other equipment. With 8 different galaxies, each with HUNDREDS of planets, there are plenty of room for exploration! Can you make your reputation all the way up to "elite"?

As promised, we are releasing the ROM for Hoppin' Mad for everyone to enjoy, free of charge, now that we have sold out of our copies of the game.  If you haven't had the chance to check it out yet, please do.  There isn't another game like it on the console, and although people find it to be unforgiving in it's difficulty at times, I find it to be quite fun.

Thanks to everyone who bought copies to help fund further projects, we're already starting on the next release and we couldn't have done it without any of you!!!

Enjoy the game, and please let us know what you think.
