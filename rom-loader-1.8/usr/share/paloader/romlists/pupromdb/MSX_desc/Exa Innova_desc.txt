Wataru - Forerunner of Zanac and Aleste (27-02-2006 20:00) 
This is an important game, and highly underestimated, for the shooters-genre on the MSX-system, because this is the first game in which the enemy forces react to your actions, although not on the same level as in Zanac, instead of just following a simple procedure.

This "intelligence" system would be worked out far better in the Zanac and Aleste games.

Some Zanac and Aleste enemies can already be seen here.
