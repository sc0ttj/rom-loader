Yep, it's a badass Technos basketball game. Being technos, it should be a given that the game concentrates more on beating the snot out of your opponents than actually playing basketball. Also being a Technos game, it should be a given that it's quite fun. Anyway, the "courts" (and I do use the term loosely) are riddled with obstacles, weapons and multi-level baskets, and are in such locales as Navy Ship Yards, downtown San Francisco, and many other zany places like that. You know, normal, Technos-style fun-fun ^_^

Ipkiss finished the game, but the disk the patch was on got corrupted. Ha! So this is a three-month old patch that isn't quite done, but it's good enough, so quit your bitching.
