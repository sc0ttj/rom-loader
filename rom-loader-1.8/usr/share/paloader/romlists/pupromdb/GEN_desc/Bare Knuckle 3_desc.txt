Translation Description:

All the text in the game has been translated. This includes both dialogue in the story mode and the win/lose quotes in the Battle mode, and the Engrish in the battle mode has been fixed. The patch has been thoroughly tested and works on the hardware. If you find a platform it doesn't work on, contact the author.

There are currently no known bugs. Please note, however, that the patch has only been tested on an American Sega Genesis Model 2. The code has been written in such a way that it should work on all models, though.
