Pete Sampras Tennis offers a unique way to play with four players without requiring an adaptor: the game has two input plugs at the top! This device is called a J-Cart, which is the first cartridge to include support for two additional joysticks or gamepads.

Besides letting you play with up to four players, the game offers four modes of tennis: Challenge (one singles or doubles match), Tournament (four to eight players with byes), World Tour, where you'll play in 33 cities around the globe, and Tutorial, which explains all of the game's controls.

Pete Sampras Tennis also includes three court types (grass, hard and clay), 32 different computer players with individual skills and appearances, instant replay, and a continue option via passwords. Over 4,000 frames of animation will show dives, backhands, serves, runs, volleys and forehands, and an umpire will call the game as a crowd looks on.
