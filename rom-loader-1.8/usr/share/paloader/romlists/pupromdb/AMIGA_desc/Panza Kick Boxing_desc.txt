CHEATS:

Hint: Stay undefeated:
Press [Esc] after your fighter has been knocked
down to avoid a loss.

Hint: Recommended moves:
Try using the upper cut, round house, low leg kick
often. The low leg kick can be used to keep your opponent out
of range and on target for a follow-up combo, such as the round
house followed by an upper cut. The double backfist is very powerful
and can result in a knockout.
