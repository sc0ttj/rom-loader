Sort of a sequel to Word Rescue, the mean bad aliens (I think they were aliens) Gruzzles are at it again, this time stealing the numbers of the world. An educational/side-scroller game, Math Rescue has very little gameplay differences with its predecessor, save for the fact that you now solve mathematical puzzles.

Trivia:

Karen Crowther originally designed the prototype for Math Rescue to entertain her children while she was at work. Later, Apogee published the game for her. The graphics of the main characters is directly modeled after Karen's son and daughter.
