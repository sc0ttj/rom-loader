Genghis Khan II: Clan of the Grey Wolf (Aoki Ookami to Shiroki Mejika: Genchou Hishi in Japan) is a video game developed by Koei. It is part of Koei's Historical Simulation Series of games, and is the sequel to Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan II was developed and published for DOS, X68000, PC-98, PC-88, Sega Genesis, and the SNES.

Gameplay:

The player is given the option to conquer either the country of Mongolia as Genghis Khan himself, or to play as a world leader and take over the known world of the time. Both conquests are made through the balance of economy, population, buying and selling manufactured goods, family relations, promoting and demoting generals, developing military, all in a turn-based fashion. All of these actions can happen only within a given amount of "turn points", so some actions are given priority while others are overlooked. The game also includes a turn-based battle sequence, allowing specific control to the player or delegated to a general.

- Scenarios -

- Scenario 1: Playing as Genghis Khan -

In the first scenario, it is the year 1184 AD in Mongolia, the player has the option of controlling four different characters (Temujin, Jamuga, Togurul Khan, and Tayan Khan. Your job is to become ruler of the Mongolian steppes (basically control all of Mongolia). At the end of this scenario, if you beat it by 1212 AD, you can take on the rest of the world in the fourth scenario, World Conquest. You get to lead the fight with the ruler you chose, and your choice of eight generals, and an advisor.

Players are given the option also of leading various other nations in all of the world-wide scenarios. These nations suffer from a lack of relatives as a generals, and significantly weaker leaders. Also absent is the ability to hire the elite Mongol units, largely viewed as the most powerful of all units in the game.

- Scenario 2: Genghis Khan's Great Ambition -

This scenario enables the player to take over the world (that was known at the time, including Europe, northern Africa, and mainland Asia). The player can select to lead various countries which are: Mongol Empire, Kamakura Shogun, Khorezm Empire, Ghore Sultanate, Angevin Kingdom, Capetian Kingdom, each with their varying strengths and weaknesses (for example, only when occupying Japan can you draft Samurai, and Japan is the starting point for the Kamakura Shogun). In the Korean version of the game the player is able to play as the Goryeo Kingdom, the Korean dynasty during the Mongol invasions.

- Scenario 3 and Scenario 4 -

In the third scenario, you are at the point of the Yuan Dynasty (1274 AD), where Kublai Khan is the ruler of Mongolia, and China. You are trying to rule the world.

The fourth scenario, World Conquest, is unlocked for the year 1185 AD. Genghis Khan starts taking over the world with his Mongol hordes. In this scenario, Genghis Khan is the default leader of the Mongol Empire, with the eight best generals and the best advisor of all the scenarios.

- Events -

- Random Occurrences -

During play, the player can expect some random events, including typhoons, droughts, epidemics, sand storms and blizzards. It also as bountiful harvests in some countries in the autumn.

- Family Relations -

An important aspect to the game is to raise your family; choose who your daughter is going to marry and who will succeed your ruler when he dies. As is the case with any scenario, without any successors, the game is over. A strong family-oriented empire is less susceptible to revolutions. The US version of the game removed the harem subgame entirely, in which you raised your affinity with one of your wives, much like a dating simulation game.

- Revolutions -

Appointing one's son as a general or governor or marrying one's daughter to an already appointed general or governor guarantees that province will not have a revolution and break away from a player's territories. This is especially important when controlling large amounts of provinces, as multiple governors may decide to revolt at the same time.

When a revolt occurs, the player relies on surrounding nations under his or her control to keep the state. If armies in surrounding states are large enough, a revolt may be put down. However, if most territories surrounding the revolting nation have low armies, the revolting nation has a high chance of winning.
