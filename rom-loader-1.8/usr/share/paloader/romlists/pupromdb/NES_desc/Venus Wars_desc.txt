When the 1.0 patch for Venus Wars was released I actually went ahead and tried it out. I saw the main playing field and I said "oh great, another strategy RPG" and didn't give it much of a chance. Cause, you know, I don't like strategy RPGs. So back to my story, I played it for not much longer and then deleted it. I didn't even fight in a single battle. Well surprise surprise, that turned out to be a mistake, since the battles are the thing that make this game great. You're not just watching yourself die; you're on your bike, fighting these helicopters and whatever else! It's a whole lot of fun, and not really much strategy involved. Which is good! Venus Wars is now my new favorite game, and one which I have every intent on finishing, eventually?

Translation Description - 
The first release of this by Anus P. actually had some stuff left undone. However necrosaro went back and fixed these, and put in a new title screen. Rejoice!

June 2008 update - Even with the 2.0 update, the ending is untranslated. It shows a bunch of garbage characters.
