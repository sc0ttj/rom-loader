Well, that Evil Witch Doctor refuses to give up! Princess Leilani may be safe, but her sister, Tina, has just been nabbed.

And this time you've got real trouble. Because not one, but EIGHT perilous islands stand between you and your honey. Get set to battle dinosaurs, survive avalanches and out fight the Evil Doctor's nastiest ghouls.

It'll be tough, that's for sure. So just remember sweet Tina, and how grateful she'll be when you come to her rescue!

New cooler weapons, more levels, bonus stages, warp zones, and secret rooms are what you will find in this very cool game. Good luck, and have fun playing Adventure Island 2.
