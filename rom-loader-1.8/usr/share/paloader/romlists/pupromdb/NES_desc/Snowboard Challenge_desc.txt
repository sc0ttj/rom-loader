Don't let the first mountain fool you, its slopes are rather similar and uninspired, but keep in mind this is the beginners' hill. The other mountains are vastly different with slopes containing half-pipes, huge gaps, cliffs, lakes, chateaus and even highways.

Learning how to pass each obstacle will keep you busy for quite a while. The variety of levels is one of this game's shining aspects. My only complaint here is that you must do specific tricks in a certain order on the half-pipes or you lose a life.
