Honyaku - Shoe-string (26-01-2008 23:21) 
Some games are designed on a shoe-string and become an instant big hit while others are designed on a shoe-string and are a punishment to play. Ample's Car Race unfortunately is one of the latter.

The object of the game is to pass black formula one cars and to keep your fuel level up. A standard racing game you say? Would be, but the fuel level drops so fast that the moment you move your car you are out of fuel. This game is unplayable and added to that there is a terrible humming noise.
