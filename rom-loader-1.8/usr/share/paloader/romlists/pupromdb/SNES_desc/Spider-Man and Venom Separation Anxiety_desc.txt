Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety is a side-scrolling beat 'em up video game and sequel to Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage, released for Sega Mega Drive and Super NES and then ported to PC, in which one or two players could team up as Spider-Man and Venom to defeat the evil symbiote Carnage. The game boasts a large number of thugs that the player has to defeat: heavily armed Jury and Venom's symbiote children.

There is also cameo assistance from Captain America, Ghost Rider, Hawkeye, and Daredevil.

The game was met with less critical response by the gaming community, especially when compared to its predecessor.

Of particular note is that the title is misleading - the plot of the comic book series Venom: Separation Anxiety involves Venom's five symbiote spawn attempting to force Eddie (without his symbiote) to help them communicate with their own symbiotes. The events of the game more closely follow the events of Venom's first limited series, Venom: Lethal Protector.

Unlimited Lives
To get unlimited lives it's kind of tricky it usually works better with 2 players but it still possible with 1 player. First get to a boss and make sure you have an extra hero to help you (Captain America, Dare Devil, Ghost Rider, etc?) Get the boss to low health and get yourself to 1 life and low health. As soon as he kills you press 'L' to get a hero's help he will kill the boos. In the next level you will have zero lives and you can die as many times as you want.  BUT MAKE SURE IF YOU HAVE ZERO LIVES DO NOT PICK UP LIVES IT WILL SET IT TO 1 LIFE AND YOU HAVE TO RE DO IT. If you have zero you can die and it will go to 9. I honestly dont no how many lives you truly have but it is a lot probably like 100 but that should be more then enough.
