Overview:

The gameplay is similar to Pok¨¦mon in that it shares the same concept of catching monsters. Your character finds a monster and raises it to battle evil. The towns are presented in a top down view. The houses, inns, bars, dungeons and shops are fixed points you can put a cursor over. The battle system features a bar of musical notes that the player uses to command the monsters. You can carry up to four monsters at a time.
