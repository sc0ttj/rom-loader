Region Difficulties

Being a Pal format European exclusive it is sought after game for players of other countries, but however a Special play through adaptor is needed to play Pal games on other systems, and this title also has a Special lock out Screen so even if an adaptor is used it, still isn't able to be played, so items like the EMS N64 Passport, still won't work, even with the Pal boot codes.
