Based on the science fiction movie "Aliens" from 1986, you try to save Ripley and the soldiers from a base far away from Earth located on the planet LV-426 which is overrun by highly dangerous creatures. You must take each of the six survivors (Ripley, Hicks, Vasquez, Gorman, Burke and Bishop) separately through the base to save them. On the way to freedom you have to shoot many aliens, face huggers, eggs and even the alien queen itself.
