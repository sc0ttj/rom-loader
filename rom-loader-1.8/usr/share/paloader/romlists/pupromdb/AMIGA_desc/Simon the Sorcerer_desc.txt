Simon is just an ordinary boy in an extra-ordinary world. A world in which he must rescue Calypso the Wizard by embarking on a long challenging quest.

The game is a point-and-click adventure, using a typical interface with words such as ?Use, ?Open, ?Walk To (unlike Lucasarts SCUMM games a simple click on that area of the screen wont do) and ?Pick Up (again, a double-click on the item doesnt suffice  these two features extend game time significantly)

The games plot has a number of references and spoofs to fantasy and fairy tales, with the Three Billy Goats Gruff involved in a particularly significant scene. The humor is very British in places, with lots of dry sarcasm, and lots of Simpsons-esque self-references to the fact that this is a computer game. The levels are non-linear in layout, with puzzles spread across the lands.
