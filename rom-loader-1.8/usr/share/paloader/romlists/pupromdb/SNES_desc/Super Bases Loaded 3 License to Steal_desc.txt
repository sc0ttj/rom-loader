The game is the sixth overall installment of the Bases Loaded series, and third installment of the secondary trilogy for the Super Nintendo. The series spanned three generations of consoles and eight total installments. The original Bases Loaded title was an arcade game that Jaleco ported to the NES. There was also a Game Boy version of Bases Loaded. Only the original Bases Loaded was an aracade game; the rest of the series were exclusive to their particular consoles. There are four video games in the Bases Loaded NES series, Bases Loaded II: Second Season, Bases Loaded 3 and Bases Loaded 4. The series continued onto the SNES platform with Super Bases Loaded, Super Bases Loaded 2, and Super Bases Loaded 3. The final entry to the series was Bases Loaded '96: Double Header, released for the fifth generation consoles Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation.

This installment is notable for being the first game in the series to use real players and teams. The game was licensed by Major League Baseball, and includes a roster of real-life players and teams.

Gameplay:

For many aspects of gameplay, such as fielding and base-running, the game offers players a choice between automatic and manual control. For example, a player who opts for manual control of his team's fielders will, when catching a fly ball, have to move the fielder of his choice into position to make the catch. Unfortunately, due to a flaw in the scrolling system used during plays, the fielding team's outfielders are often offscreen, often making it extremely difficult to successfully complete a play in manual mode.

The game has also been criticized for the audio samples used to voice its umpire, characterized by some as incongruous and/or inappropriately effete. In particular, the samples used when calling strikes (and strikeouts) have been likened to the Yes Guy (a character from The Simpsons, who was in turn based on a character created by Frank Nelson).

One major flaw in the game is that one pitch, the split-finger fastball, cannot be hit if it is thrown high in the strike zone. A perfect game with 27 strikeouts can be thrown at will by using only this pitch. Only a handful of pitchers in the game can throw the pitch, however.
