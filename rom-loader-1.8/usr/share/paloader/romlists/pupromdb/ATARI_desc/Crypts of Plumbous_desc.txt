In this game, you have to fight alien ships who are trying to raid underground Nuclear waste storage for some unknown reason and unleash it on the planet. The game is a side scrolling shoot-em up, which is kind of reminiscent of Defender. There are various skill levels, from "Very Easy" to "Really Tough".
