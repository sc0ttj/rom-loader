In 1999, the Krion Empire robot battalion descended upon the earth, and brought the planet to the brink of destruction. The Krion Empire demanded the immediate and unconditional surrender of the world. When planet Earth refused, the Krion Empire started a massive general attack.

The Krion Empire set up large bases at points all over the world from which they sent out their robots. The robot hordes attacked indiscriminately. Their power overwhelmed even the most advanced armaments of the world. Nearly everyone believed the world would soon be ruled by the Krion Empire.
