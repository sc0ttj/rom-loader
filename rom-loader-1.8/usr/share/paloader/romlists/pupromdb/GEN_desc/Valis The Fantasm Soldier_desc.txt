Yuko Ahso was once an ordinary high school girl. Or least her life used to be ordinary. Her friend Reiko went out on a date with a Dark King named Rogles, and has vanished. Immediately, monsters attacked her. She was almost killed...

Until a mystic sword named Valis appeared before her.

Using the sword, Yuko defended herself against the monsters, and was whisked to a strange land, where she was told that she was the chosen Valis Warrior, and she must defeat Rogles, or the human world and the dream world would both be plunged into chaos.

Go forth, brave Valis Warrior, and destroy the evil known as Rogles!

Hints:

Max HP/MP - This requires 2 controllers. At any time during actual gameplay, Pause the game with controller 1, then, on controller 2, press right+a+b. This will fill up your HP/MP to the max. You can do this however many times you like.

Alternative - If you don't have 2 controllers, you can still do the code. After pausing on controller 1, switch it with controller 2's port and then proceed with the rest of the code.
