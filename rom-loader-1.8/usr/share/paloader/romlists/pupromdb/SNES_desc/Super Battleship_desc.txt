The game had two modes: Super Battleship mode and Classic Battleship mode. Classic Battleship mode is essentially an electronic version of the board gameBattleship. Super Battleship is a naval simulator played by sailing ships to a close enough range to shoot one's opponent's ships. Ships have four different weapons: missiles, torpedoes, depth charges, and guns.
