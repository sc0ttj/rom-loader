NOTE - Only works in NestopiaX

Remember that time where all the popular Street Fighter characters, led by Ryu. Put aside all their differences. Learned to use guns, and fought in a mission deep in the jungle to protect the free world from Cobra?

Wasn't that great!?

Or it could just be a Pirate hack of the NES "G.I. Joe" game.
