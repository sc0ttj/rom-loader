A fast action shoot 'em up, Xenon 2 has gorgeous parallax graphics, music by Bomb The Bass (Megablast) and a wealth of visual imagination to add to the appeal. A classic from The Bitmap Brothers - big, slick and still one of the best looking (and sounding) games around.

Gameplay:

Xenon 2 Megablast is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up. Unusually for the genre, the player's spaceship can reverse the scrolling of the play area for a limited distance, which is useful for escaping from dead ends. This game consists of five levels which are each divided into two sections.

The game has a generic sci-fi theme and almost no plot, focusing instead on presentation and gameplay. Indeed, it was the quality of the music and graphics that led to the game's memorability. The graphics bear the trademark "Bitmap Brothers" appearance, with realistic and detailed renditions of rock and metal objects. The enemies are various nondescript organic creatures.

The player of Xenon 2 Megablast must rely heavily on power-ups, which may be gained by shooting power-up containers that appear through the levels. When an enemy or a wave of enemies are destroyed they leave behind credits in the shape of bubbles. Small bubbles are worth 50 credits and large bubbles are worth 100. When a mid-level boss or end of level boss are destroyed, they explode to reveal lots of credit bubbles. Credits are then spent at a shop owned by Colin The Alien (who bears a remarkable resemblance to the alien from the film Predator). Power-ups of various sorts may be bought there. Accumulating power-ups rewards the player with more heavy-duty firepower. The shop appears mid-level and at the end of the level.
