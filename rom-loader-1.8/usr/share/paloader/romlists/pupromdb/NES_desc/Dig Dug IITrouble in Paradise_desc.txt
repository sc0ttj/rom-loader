In this episode, DIG DUG's job is to protect peaceful islands. But as in the original arcade classic, his arch rivals POOKA and FYGAR come burrowing up to lay waste to his tropical paradise. With his great intuition, DIG DUG has prepared for the impending onslaught by driving spikes into the ground and readying his trusty drill and inflator. 

Team up with DIG DUG through 72 rounds of challenging play to defeat his enemies and bring peace back to his tropical paradise. Only with careful strategic use of the spikes can you and DIG DUG win.
