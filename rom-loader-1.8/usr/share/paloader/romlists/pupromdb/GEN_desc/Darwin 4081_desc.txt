The gameplay in Darwin 4081 is very intense. Similar to other shooters, you will get lots of targets coming to you at once. The design of the enemy targets varies from small spacecraft to other ground objects. By killing certain specific targets, you will receive power-ups for your spacecraft. Your spacecraft will then grow larger with improvements in its armaments and overall response.

At the end of a level, you will have to fight a boss. Depending on which level you are in, You will get to fight a giant caterpillar, a telephone, a large hovering pyramid, an octopus or a giant robotic dragon.

For your armaments, You will have a forward firing charge particle gun for air targets and a downward firing cannons for ground objects. Also to add, the armament type you carry can vary depending on the type of power-ups you take.

As for the difficulty, the game gets harder and harder as you progress through the levels. Making you concentrate on every single approaching bullet. One wrong move can sent your spacecraft into a fireball.
