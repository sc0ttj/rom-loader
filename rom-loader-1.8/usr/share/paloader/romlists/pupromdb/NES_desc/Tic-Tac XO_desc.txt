Sly Dog Studios debuts on the Nintendo Entertainment system with Tic-Tac XO! Not being a regular game of tic-tac-toe, you can gain power-ups to up your game and demolish the computer. Power-ups include the ability to take an extra turn, change one of the computer's tiles, clear a row, and clear a column.

If you have a need to play tic-tac-toe, but need an extra boost in your game, look no further than Tic-Tac XO!

Much more than a reproduction, this original game cartridge is built using all new parts. No donor carts were harmed in the making of this game.
