Mr Bloopy is an unreleased game by Rare. DreamTR managed go aquire a prototype of this game. It is a puzzle-oriented platform game. Before this find, this game was completely unknown. Here is what DreamTR had to say about the game:

It's a puzzle side scroller. You can change colors by pressing various buttons, you shoot droplets out, and you have to put picture puzzle pieces in proper places. A very peculiar game. 

As I mentioned before, this game is a complete mystery. Perhaps someone who worked at Rare could clarify this?
