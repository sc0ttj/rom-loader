Nintendo Censorship - 
What is lesser known about the US release of the game is that DREK "empire" is actually the resurrected Nazi regime - Nintendo removed all Nazi references. The final boss, Smirk, is supposed to be a cyborg version of Adolf Hitler. The removal of all Nazi/Hitler references can be likened to NES game Top Secret - Hitler no Fukkatsu (Bionic Commando in the US).

Although Nintendo of America attempted to remove all Nazi references, some escaped censor. For example, a file retrieved by Togo during a base infiltration in Greece retains a swastika on it, which is visible in the player's inventory area.

It should be noted that Nintendo required that Golgo had his profession changed to spy rather than assassin.

Sexual Themes, Violence and Smoking - 
Golgo 13 is one of the first Nintendo games to feature sex, drug use and graphic violence, an unusual release because at the time, Nintendo of America had strict content guidelines preventing the release of such content on its systems. Although the depictions were either implied or limited by the 8 bit technology of the NES, the content is mild when compared to modern video games, and was not controversial at the time of its release.

In the maze levels featured in the game, as well as one "sniper mode" mission in East Berlin, enemies are seen briefly bleeding from the head when killed. While the depiction is fairly tame due to the limited technology, most NES games at this time did not feature blood.

In the beginning of the mission in Greece, if the player walks to the right several paces and then walks back to the beginning of the level, a pack of cigarettes is seen on the ground - Golgo 13 is seen smoking if the player walks over the cigarettes, and his health is restored.

Throughout his lengthy mission, Golgo 13 encounters many female operatives who not only offer intelligence, but also themselves. The actual depiction of sexual consummation takes the shape of two small and primitive shaped silhouettes briefly coming together and voyeuristically viewed from a distant, wide-angle shot of hotel room window. In a strangely comedic twist, the player's energy is restored in the morning.

In the sequel, The Mafat Conspiracy, scenes are even more 'graphic' taking into consideration the technology of the time.
