CHEATS:

Easier scene selection:
Enter the slapping game and pull Curly's ear until the timer runs out to slow down the scene selector.

Easy points:
On the "Doctor Wanted" section, push your gurneys at the at the same speed as the male nurse that is pushing the patient, but stay slightly behind them. This will reduce the risk of collision.
