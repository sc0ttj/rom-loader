Directions - 
Use your basic Punch and Kick (Up to jump) against the enemies as you move to the left. Eventually (If you killed enough enemies in the right area) a mini boss will show up. Defeat them and you will gain a power. Rinse and repeat until you beat all five then rush to the doors quickly!

TOURNAMENT MODE - 
There are a few extra moves you can do by pushing in a direction with the control pad, and hitting A+B at once when your KO meter is full.
