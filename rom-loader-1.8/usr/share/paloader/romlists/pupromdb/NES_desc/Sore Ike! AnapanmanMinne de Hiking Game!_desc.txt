This game is based upon Anpanman's travels around the world helping people. But what is Anpanman? He's a superhero whose head is made out of sweet rolls filled with bean jam.

No joke.

This game has you playing as Anpanman (or his friends Currypanman and Shokupanman) as you try to beat Baikinman to the end of the board you're playing. There are eight boards in all, and three players can go at it. It's no Mario Party, and there are only -three- minigames, but it's fun at least, and not too complicated.

Too bad that witch Dokinchan cheats at Jan-Ken-Pon. Hussy. Just 'cause she's a girl?

Translation Description - 
The game, sadly, is still unfinished. There are tons of untranslated graphics abound, and there are some text display glitches relating to Japanese punctuation. And then there's the whole grammar thing.

But the thing's pretty playable! And even if it's not too polished, you can see that Pope Hentai worked a lot on it. Maybe a future version will fix these errors.

Or maybe Wilford Brimley will make a cameo, I dunno.
