Master of Weapon is a game released by Taito for arcades and for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It is a basic shoot 'em up game in which the player controls a space ship that has upgradeable weapons. These upgrades are collected by destroying green transport vessels which release the upgrade for the player to pick up.

Gameplay:

The spaceship starts with a basic photon cannon and air-to-ground bombs. Both of these weapons can fire continuously without a need for pause. The photon cannon can be upgraded five times for up to five streams of photons by collecting P upgrades. Additionally, the exhaust of the ship can be used as a weapon.

Special Weapons

Special weapons can be collected by picking up boxes with specific labels through destroying transport vessels.
P- Pier- Essentially the same as the conventional air-to-ground bomb. This is the default special weapon.
L- Laser- Very powerful but has a short range. It can attack both air and ground targets.
G- Guide- Shoots several green projectiles that track all targets on screen, self-destruct, and destroy the target.
W- Wide- a somewhat powerful launch of several projectiles in a star pattern.
H- H-Bomb- destroys all enemies on the screen for a few seconds. Can only be used once.
S- Increases the exhaust of the ship, allows it to damage enemies at a further range and increases movement speed of the ship.
