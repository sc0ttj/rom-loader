This is the second Spider-Man adventure to land on the Game Boy. One day, Peter Parker wakes up feeling not so well. Things turn worse for Parker when he picks up the morning paper and reads that Spider-Man has been accused of commiting a robbery. So Spidey sets out on a quest to clear his name.

Gameplay this time around is slightly deeper than the previous title. Controls for jumping, punching, and web slinging are similar, but now Spider-Man can pick up objects that allow him to perform certain actions. For example, in the first level you need to find a key to unlock a door, and a can of oil to activate a hover bike.

The city is at risk, and only you can save it from the evil clutches of an old enemy--the powerful Electro. He has a mysterious new device that makes his million volts of destruction even deadlier. But now Spider-Man has Insulated Armor, which makes him impervious to electricity, in addition to new powers such as Ice and Taser-Webbing. With your new bag of tricks, you can stop Electro, Sandman, and other villains' nefarious schemes to bring the city to its knees.
