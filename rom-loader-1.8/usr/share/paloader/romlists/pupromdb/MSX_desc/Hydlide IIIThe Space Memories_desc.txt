After the evil dragon lord Varalys tried to enchant the princess Ann, he was thought to be defeated by a brave warrior. But evil can never be defeated once and for all - once again, a curse has fallen upon the land, and you, a nameless young boy, is the only one who can save it. Equipped with your magical sword, you must roam the land of Hydlide and defeat the evil once again.

This is the second NES game of Hydlide series ("Hydlide 2" was only available for the MSX platform). You can choose one of the four character classes to start the game with, and also upgrade your class during the game. The combat is action-based: you can either attack your enemies by ramming them with your weapons, or cast magical spells. In towns there are equipment and items to buy.
