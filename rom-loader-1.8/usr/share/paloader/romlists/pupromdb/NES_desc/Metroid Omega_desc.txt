Celebrating the release of Metroid Prime/Fusion, I created Metroid Omega. Every graphic of the game is changed thanks to Jorge Fuentes's great artistic skill, and Brinstar is transformed into an evil deathtrap. Once I finish a few other projects, the rest of the levels will be made just as evil as it, so have fun trying to survive!
