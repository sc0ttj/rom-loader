The game is the sixth overall installment of the Bases Loaded series, and second installment of the secondary series for the Super Nintendo. The series spanned three generations of consoles and eight total installments. The original Bases Loaded title was an arcade game that Jaleco ported to the NES. There was also a Game Boy version of Bases Loaded. Only the original Bases Loaded was an arcade game; the rest of the series were exclusive to their particular consoles.

There are four video games in the Bases Loaded NES series, Bases Loaded II: Second Season, Bases Loaded 3 and Bases Loaded 4. The series continued onto the SNES platform with Super Bases Loaded, Super Bases Loaded 2, and Super Bases Loaded 3. The final entry to the series was Bases Loaded '96: Double Header, released for the fifth generation consoles Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation.

Gameplay:

The battery backup allowed players to save several categories of statistics for all 14 teams in the two leagues and not just their own. The DSP chip allowed a rudimentary 3-D perspective for batting and sometimes infield play. When players swung, their own individual numbers appeared on the back of their jerseys.

There were seven teams each in the "Alpha League" and the "Omega League" that went by city names only, and often borrowed symbols from those of the original Super Bases Loaded. The nicknames in quotation marks are those of the original SBL teams for whom the symbols were based, but do not appear in the game. The Alpha League consisted of the Boston "Kings," the Chicago "Lizards," the Cleveland "Stars," the Detroit "Storm," the Kansas City "Tornadoes", Oakland, and Seattle. The Omega League consisted of the Atlanta "Weasels," Houston, the Los Angeles "Cyclops," the New York "Mercs," Philadelphia, the Pittsburgh "Buzzards," and the San Francisco "Amoebas."

In addition, there were four edit teams: Urbana, Rockford, Peoria, and Aurora.
