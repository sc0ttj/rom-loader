Overview:

This game was released for the Sega Genesis (known as Mega Drive in japan) back in 1990 for japan only, based on a japanese woman wrestler named Cuty Suzuki. At this time japanese women's wrestling was getting really popular that they released video games on some consoles.

They made several for the Super Famicom, some which played really good. This one was the only one released for the Sega Genesis. Cuty Suzuki was starting to get popular at the time, but it was only because of her looks than her wrestling ability that got her a big push. I don't know if this game was intended for teenage boys and men or everyone though.
