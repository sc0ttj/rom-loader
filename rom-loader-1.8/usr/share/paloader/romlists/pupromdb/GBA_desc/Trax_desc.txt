It's the zaniest bunch of enemies ever! And they said it could only be done on the big screen. It's a head-to-head battle through the Grasslands, the Desert Base and the Cave Base on your way to the Capitol City and the Master Tank Master himself! Four big levels in the Main Game, 12 different layouts in the Multi-Game, each with a different terrain and cast of unusual opponents. Continue feature and varied soundtrack for hours of fun! Handicap feature in Multi-Play mode evens out the competition. Fun graphics and exciting gameplay!
