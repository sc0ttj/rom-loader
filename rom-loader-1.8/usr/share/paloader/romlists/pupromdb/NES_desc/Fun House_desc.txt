You're trapped in the FUN HOUSE! How do you find your way out?! You start the game with three rollerbladers. If you maneuver your way out of one room in the limited amount of time, you go on to the next room. But to move on, you must smack all the targets with your tomatoes as you whiz by. Pick up the power objects to gain advantages like more rollerbladers or more time.

It's a slippery, slimey trip through 72 rooms, full of blobs and boingers, flying banana chips and schmutz balls. So getting through the rooms gets harder and gooier as you go along. Have fun!

Everybody's favorite alcoholic clown from the hit animated TV show THE SIMPSONS makes his way to the NES with KRUSTY'S FUN HOUSE. It's infested with purple rats and Krusty needs your help to exterminate the little vermin. While Bart and Homer man the rat traps, it's up to you to herd them into the traps, where they'll be taken care of.

Of course, the rats have friends that will stop at nothing to make sure you are unsuccessful snakes, aliens, and flying pigs will all be out to get you, so you'd better be smart and fast if you're going to survive. You've got Krusty's custard pies at your disposal, and while they may not taste good, they do make excellent weapons! Head into the Fun House and get rid of those nasty rats in KRUSTY'S FUN HOUSE.
