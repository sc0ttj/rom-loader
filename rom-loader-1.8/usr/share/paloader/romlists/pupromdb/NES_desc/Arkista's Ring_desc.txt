You play a cute little elf named Christine who is trying to retrieve Arkista's ring. You must battle one hundred twenty five levels of mazes and enemies to reach your goal. If you get to the end, you are allowed to start over with faster, harder enemies. Be sure to collect as many magic items as you can, such as the cure potions and the wand that lets you shoot fire balls.
