The evil company known only as "The Corporation" has developed a deadly hybrid plague -- a disease so powerful and infectious that it is capable of wiping out the entire population of Earth in just a few days. As Dr. Caine, a research scientist for The Corporation, you suspect foul play. You hack into some classified documents and discover the nefarious plan: The Corporation intends on unleashing this plague so they can force world governments to cough up billions of dollars for the cure.

The director of The Corporation finds you out before you can alert the authorities, and he injects you with a green glowing liquid. Instead of killing you, as the director intended, the green liquid transforms you into a dangerous mass of Ooze, leaving only your head and one fist intact. Equipped with your new powers, you vow to exact revenge on The Corporation, for yourself and for the world.

As the blob of Ooze, you slime your way around a toxic dump, a waste plant, a genetics lab, a power core, and a plague factory, hunting down remnants of your DNA helixes (so you can regain your human form), punching and spitting on mutated creatures, and flipping levers that open doors and shut down deadly machines. To assist you in your oozing, power-ups will boost your speed, give you an extra life, fortify you with industrial strength, and increase your mass. You can also increase your ooze in bonus rounds where you catch mutated rabbits.
