Rocko's Modern Life is a two-dimensional side-scrolling platform game, and the player controls Rocko. There are four sets of stages in which Rocko's dog Spunky has wandered off in search of an object that catches his attention: Sand in Your Navel (set at the beach), Trash-O-Madness (set at the dump), Ice Scream (set in O-Town itself), and Unbalanced Load (set in the laundromat), and each individual stage consists of four different levels. Except for Ice Scream all of the levels were based on episodes of the show. Rocko's goal in every level is to keep Spunky safe from danger. This means activating platforms and switches at specific times, as well as feeding Spunky certain items and defeating enemies in the way.

It is one of the very few games on the SNES to feature voice acting.
