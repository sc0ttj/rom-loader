One day, Spider-Man is out doing his usual routine of keeping the city clean from muggers and skateboarders, when he is attacked by robots! Spider-Man must figure out who is behind the robot attack and put a stop to it in his third Game Boy adventure.

Gameplay this time around is very similar to the second game. Spider-Man's various moves, such as web slinging and kicks, will allow him to fight off foes and advance through the side-scrolling levels.
