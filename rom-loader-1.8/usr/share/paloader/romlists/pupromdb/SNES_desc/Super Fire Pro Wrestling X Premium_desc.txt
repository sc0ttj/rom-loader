To hell with all that THQ crap, Fire Pro's where it's at, kids. What this version brings to the table is a pretty damn thorough create-a-wrestler mode. And, I dunno, probably some other stuff.

Translation Description:

Almost everything is finished in this patch, with what's not done being pretty damned inconsequential. There's a whole hell of a lot of abbreviations going on here, but that couldn't be helped I guess.

Tips:

Unlockables
100 Stat Points for created players 
Win the Triple Crown in one division.
150 Stat points for created players. 
Take a created wrestler to win Triple 
crowns in BOTH divisions.
