Now you can take the action from the blacktop to the hardwood with ROUNDBALL - 2-On-2 Challenge for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Instead of playing on the playground, the action moves to a full-sized arena, complete with glass backboards and an appreciative crowd watching the action.

This is teamwork at its finest, as you work pick-and-rolls, give-and-go's, and isolation plays that will get you an easy bucket. And if you're open, bury the three-pointer and leave your opponents shaking their heads. You can play alone with a computer-controlled teammate, challenge the computer with a friend, or recruit three friends and go for an all-out four-player game. No matter how you play, the action in ROUNDBALL - 2-On-2 Challenge is fast and furious. It's going to separate the champs from the chumps.
