In February 2001, we celebrate NES game "Bart vs. The Space Mutants' 10 years of existance... My way to celebrate this was to produce a game hack. If you played "Swamp Thing", will realize that the sounds and playability of that game are very similar to Simpsons games - the authors are the same. So, I hacked Swamp Thing and made "The Simpsons - Return of the Space Mutants" I changed the characters, backgrounds and text.
