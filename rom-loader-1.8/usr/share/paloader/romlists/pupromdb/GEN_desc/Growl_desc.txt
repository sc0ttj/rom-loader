Gameplay:

At the beginning of the game the player selects one of four rangers: Gen, Burn, Khan, or Jack (these names came from the Genesis port and the four were unnamed in the arcade version). Like with most beat em up games each are balanced out with specific strengths and weaknesses in attack, jump, and life.

The action starts immediately as the four heroes fight after their bar is attacked by evil poachers. The game is continuous through six stages of foes wielding various weapons that the player can freely pick up and use as well. Periodically through each of these stages the player will have to rescue animals from abuse and the animals in turn will aid the player for a certain amount of time, either by damaging enemies or killing them outright. One example of this is when you free an elephant at the end of stage four and it follows you into stage five, running over enemies and even decimating a tank ready to destroy you.

Growl is very much like the beat-em-up fighting games of its time. No matter which of the four heroes you choose, their stories are the same and they all have the same ending. But the game itself definitely provides a level of difficulty with its supply of enemies jammed into the screen to fight you.
