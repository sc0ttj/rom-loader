Eskel and Sogrom are the greatest magicians in the land, and both are hungry for power. The long war between them is beginning to enter Endgame, in the Rochebrume cluster of 23 islands, each with their own special range of magic on offer.

The game is highly strategic, with icon-based controls and a turn-based structure similar to Battle Isle. You will need to destroy the rival wizard's forces on each island. It's important to hold as many castles as possible, so as to generate the maximum amount of magic. Magic is used to move and create your forces, and to weaken your opposition.

An alien race watched the wars on Earth as television shows. After a period of peace threatens the ratings, two alien scientists go back in time on various continents of the planet and start to deploy modern weaponry on them. When they return to the present, Earth is engulfed in chaos. A British scientist discovers the conspiracy and using his new invention, the soul transfer machine, sends a boy called Billy to be incarnated on a native of the different time periods.

Legends is an action-adventure with Zelda-inspired gameplay. The player controls a character pertinent to the time period (an American indian in 1400 AD-America, a knight in medieval England, a Chinese warrior in imperial China, an Egyptian acolyte in ancient Egypt and Billy in the alien spaceship). These characters collect objects and coins to buy items, weapons to fight the enemies and hearts to increase the health bar (located on the top-left of the screen). Pressing 1, 2 and 3 switches between the available weapons. Other characters provide clues and level objectives. Each epoch has bosses to be defeated and mini-games (for example, on the Chinese level there's a race on the Great Wall). After solving each time period, the game displays a password that can be entered at the start on the main screen. There is no form of saving progress while playing the main game.
