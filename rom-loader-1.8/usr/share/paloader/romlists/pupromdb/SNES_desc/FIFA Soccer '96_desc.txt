The SNES and Mega Drive versions use an updated version of FIFA 95's engine with new teams and graphics. Also, in addition to the eight national leagues of the previous game, three leagues debuted in the game: Scottish Premier League, Allsvenskan and Malaysia Super League - a lineup that would stay for the next two editions as well.
