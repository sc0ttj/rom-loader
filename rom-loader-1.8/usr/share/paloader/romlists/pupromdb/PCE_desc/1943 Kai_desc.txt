This is an enhanced version of 1943, with most of the graphics and sounds reworked. There are also changes in the weapons and the inclusion of anachronical items such as laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground. The player controls a biplane Boeing Stearman E75 N68828 instead of the P-38.

The PC Engine adaptation adds some original levels to those from the arcade version, as well as animated intermissions.
