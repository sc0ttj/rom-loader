Ballblazer is a one-on-one soccer match set in the future. You control a robot and try to snare a floating ball called a Plasmorb, which could then be fired or carried into the opponent's goal.

You play on a simple 3d playfield which is split in half. You can play against the computer or against another robot controlled by a human player.

Easter Eggs:

Designer David Levine states that if you win a game in the first minute, you'll get the author's initials in the lower-right corner of the playfield. When on title screen type the word "AUTHOR" (you have to start typing after the center text fades in, and finish before it starts fade out). You will see the credits.

The game is played from an angled overhead point of view of the field which scrolls to follow the action. If your team has the ball, you control whichever player is currently dribbling the ball, otherwise you can control any one player at a time while the computer controls the rest of your team.

Various time lengths can be selected for each game, you can kick the ball low, medium or high, and there are throw-ins, corner kicks, goal kicks. When playing against the computer several different skill levels are available.

Sort of a soccer game with a twist of dodgeball. You have to kick the ball into the goal and defenders sometimes get knocked out or deflect your shots.

Every feature you could possibly want in a video soccer game has been packed into this cartridge: two teams of 11 players each (they look like little wooden pegs, but so what) trotting up and down the full-length field that scrolls laterally in three sections, kicking and passing a black and white checkered ball, scoring goals past the hapless goalie... it's all here.

So are the countless play options that allow you and as many as three other players to divide into teams with or without the computer helping out one or both teams. There is even a hopeless option where you attempt to challenge the computer alone. Include the possibilities of other variables such as different time limits and difficulty levels and you will soon decide the only thing left out of this game is a British announcer.

But despite the countless alternatives, there are only two of any competitive consequence. First you can watch the computer play itself to a draw, or you can remove the computer from all competition and stick to human opponents. Invite the computer to play against you (he is totally merciless) or be on your team (he is an insufferable showoff) and you immediately become the weakest player on the field. Your team is actually better off without you.

Another problem with the game becomes apparent when you want to gain control of a player. Pushing the fire button will activate the member of your team closest to the ball and he will stop moving and proudly display the number of your joystick port. This means that just as you need the player most he stands still, if only for a fraction of a second. Or say the player you really need to activate is the goalie. If he is not the nearest to the ball, forget it. By the time he has earned that distinction the opponent has probably scored.

Your best chance of enjoying the game is to find some friends of equal talent and go for it. You can play until your thumbs turn stiff and your wrists freeze up but you'll never be able to compete in the computer's league.

Never pass the ball across the front of your own goal. It is an open invitation for the other side to score.
