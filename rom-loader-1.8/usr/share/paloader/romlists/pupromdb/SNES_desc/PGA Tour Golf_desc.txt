PGA Tour is the collective name of a series of golf computer and video games published by Electronic Arts and later their EA Sports sub-label from 1990 to 1998, when EA began publishing their golf games with the endorsement of Tiger Woods. After Tiger Woods '99 was released, subsequent titles were named Tiger Woods PGA Tour, and for the first time, regularly.

The series were responsible for several innovations in the genre, such as the now standard three-click swing method, but unlike other games in the EA Sports label, the series were often shadowed by other competitors such as the Jack Nicklaus series, Links, Microsoft Golf or The Golf Pro.
