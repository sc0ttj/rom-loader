This game was completed, and I had the chance to chat with Eric Browning about the it:

Mickey never saw the light of day. It was complete, I can't remember what happened. I tried animating Mickey- but Disney does not mess around with that guy and I simply am not trained as an animator. We sent it to Little Gangsters in L.A, an animation house Disney worked with. They did amazing animation- I was humbled by that.

I got a ROM of Mickey, wow, I've come a long way. Pretty neat to see it, I remember every little pixel. The animation isn't as good as I remember, partly due to my inexperience and in large part because I think the programmer was forced to remove frames.
