The Worlds of Ultima titles took the Avatar into strange and mysterious places outside the scope of a conventional dungeon-based RPG. This one visits Eodon, an Amazonian world dominated by dinosaurs. There are dozens of characters to interact with, including stone-age tribes, mad scientists and lizardmen. Get ready to fight for survival as gorillas, pterodanodons and tigers encroach. All this is done in a familiar engine somewhere between those used to Ultima VI and Ultima VII

Trivia:

One thing about finishing this game is that all completing the quests do is gain you levels and tell you where to go to kill the end villian. In hind sight, if you were powerful enough you could just go straight there and kill her and complete the game.
