You are The Master, a deity who once protected a world full of worshippers from any evil that would threaten the peace. The Evil One, hereinafter referred as Tanzra, sent his six guardians to conquer your world and defeat you in the process. After Tanzra and his guardians entrapped you in the Sky Palace after a brutal battle, where you have been recovering your strength in a deep sleep for the past few hundred years.

Good luck!
