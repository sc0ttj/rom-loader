The mighty wizard Anthrax, in an attempt to usurp authority over the kingdom, has summoned a horrifying Demon. The Demon makes good on his chartered task by summoning a horde of monsters to lay waste to the kingdom at large. Fortuitously, a random stranger is strolling nearby the kingdom and realizes that only he can beat back the foul creatures.

After some encouragement from the king, your adventurer begins the game by horseback, jumping over obstacles, beating flying creatures, and collecting potions on the ground.
Afterward, the hero must proceed on foot and destroy creatures with his blade as well as additional potions and weapons he will find on his deadly quest.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Wrath of the Demon is a computer game developed by a Quebec-based team called Abstrax. Versions for Atari ST, Amiga, PC and Mac were released in Early 1991. There was also a Commodore 64 version.
The player controls a hero on a quest to defeat a demon. Gameplay styles include hack 'n' slash (combat at close quarters), horse riding, etc.
The nine musical tracks are by David Whittaker. The programmers for the Amiga version were David Foster, Pierre Proulx and Martin Ross. The game was designed and arted out by Claude Pelletier.
Reviewer David Upchurch at the time claimed the Amiga version was better than Shadow of the Beast 2, calling it "technically (...) the most accomplished and polished game yet written for the Amiga". He gave it 884 out of a possible 1000 points. It features very smooth continuous scrolling during the horseback sequences.
