Take control of a super cyborg called Biomech, Earth's secret weapon in the battle against alien invasion. Adventure through four warped landscapes, from the dark forest home of the resistance, through the stratosphere, to Plasma Port, and then onto the alien's Battle Station. Penetrate the station's defenses and make your way through the maze-like interior in order to destroy the station and end the alien's occupation of Earth.
