This is a lost translation that was thought to have been lost forever. A board user named Squireforhire searched and was able to find the patches.

I've re-created the patch as LunarIPS reported something wrong with the original patch (despite the fact that it works) and I've added a readme and some information that I took from the archived website.

The translation is complete with some words being shortened.
