Based on the 1984 Data East coin-op.

Game Review by Santulli Slant - 
This game tries hard to be everything BUT unique. Power it up and it plays quite a bit like the classic Choplifter. All of this under a decidedly Metal Gear presentation. Despite its efforts to imitate, it stands fairly well on its own.
