Carnival music fills the air as the sun shines and everybody enjoys a day out at the carnival.  Happy crowds speed past you on the rollercoaster, their shouts and screams echoing across the fairground.

But not all the cries are cries of pleasure! Butcher Bill and Ruthless Rick are out to ruin the fun.  You are Super Sam and it is your job to stop these two gangsters from murdering the happy carnival crowd.

As they toss missiles at the ferris wheels and plant bombs on the roller-coaster, you must try and save the passengers from a horrible death.  When everyone is safe, you then have the chance to shoot these two terrible thugs out of the sky-lift.

A dangerous day at the carnival!
