Think Digdug, on a much much larger scale, with odd powerups and keys and monsters that appear out of absolutely nowhere. After you're done thinking, you'll probably think it sounds a lot like Hotman. Basically, I just described the whole thing, and there's not much else to say. You just go around getting keys, so you can advance to the next stage. Sounds simple? Of course not! All in all it's a pretty fun game, worth a try at least once, even though I can't get past the second level. I really really suck.

Translation Description - 
I don't think much needed to be translated here. On another note, isn't the new title screen sweet? InVerse did some seriously great work here. Hurray.
