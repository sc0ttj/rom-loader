Super Mario Land is the first Game Boy platformer for Mario.

In Super Mario Land you, as Mario, must save Princess Daisy, rather than Princess Toadstool, from her kidnappers, all the while collecting bonuses (mushrooms and plants that will give you the ability to grow and launch fireballs), coins (a hundred of which will grant you an extra life) and move through bizarre lands, battling the evil minions.

This is a hack of Super Mario Land version 1.1 for gameboy. I started making this after playing Frank15's enemy rearrangement hack. I thought it was great but I thought it needed more. So I started touching up the graphics and stuff. Then I wound up getting the idea of colorizing it. I held that off till I finished making the graphics. I made sure to leave no graphic untouched. Anyhow I had downloaded a 2.4 colorizer long ago and used it to colorize this. There was some problems that all people who have colorized this expereinced. Luckily Parasyte offered to lend me a hand and fixed a problem I was having with the status bar. After the colorization I altered a few more sprites then released it. About a year later a friend (Ugetab) offered to help me further on my hack and fixed the remaining issues I have. And so now you have this version. I believe this will be the final version.

Features of this hack:

- Rearranged enemies.

- Improved graphics.

- Black and white and a special color version.
