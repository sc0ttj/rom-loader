Richard Scarry's Busytown is a Sega Genesis and MS-DOS game that was released for a younger generation of gamers. The game consists of an interactive story book that was written by Richard Scarry. Most of the game is spent exploring Busytown looking for things to interact with using either the gamepad or a special mouse that could be purchased separately from the game and the console system. Young gamers will do everything from building things to delivering something to repair a ship. Games are relatively short and can be finished in about an hour. Familiar faces from Richard Scarry's works of literature include Huckle Cat and Lowly Worm.

There is also a game where the player controls the wind and can cause controlled havoc at the city park. All games offer basic vocabulary practice as simple puzzles help improve basic problem solving and English language skills. The voice quality of this game is realistic when compared to the cartoons of that era. All of the characters act and talk like their counterparts in the books and the cartoon series. If the player puts too much lemonade or soda in the glass and spills some out of the glass, then one of the characters asks the player "Are you blind?" in a gentle voice. Delivering stuff allows the town to slowly come to life; similar to a juvenile version of SimCity.
