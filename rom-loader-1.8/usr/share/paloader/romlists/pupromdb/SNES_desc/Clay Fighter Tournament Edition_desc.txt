Clayfighter: Tournament Edition was a Super Nintendo exclusive fix of the original with many things changed, such as:

 - Most stages from the original were modified. Bad Mr. Frosty & Blob's stages had no changes, however (as well as N. Boss's stage, since his was just a recolor of Blob's stage), while the other six fighters had edited stages. The edits were either slightly edited, some redone from scratch.

 - Many glitches from the original were fixed. Notably, the glitch to play as N. Boss was removed.

 - Many new modes were added, more versus modes were added, since it is a 'tournament' edition.

 - The intro and title screen were edited.
