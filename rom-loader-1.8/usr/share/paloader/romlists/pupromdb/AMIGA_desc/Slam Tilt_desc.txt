Liquid Dezign featured many of the Digital Illusions team who developed 21st Century's hit pinball games, and after the generally-disliked Pinball Mania from another team, they produced one last Amiga pinball game.

The game features four different tables, each with different layouts and features. A large number of sub-games are included, as well as a variety of animations on the LCD panel at the top. Each table has multi-ball features, with the view automatically switching to full-screen when this is activated. in total there are six different viewpoints, and no less than 47 different game modes are promised.
