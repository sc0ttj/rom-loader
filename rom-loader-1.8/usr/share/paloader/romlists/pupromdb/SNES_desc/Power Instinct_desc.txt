The Goketsuji clan . . . Every five years, a hand-to-hand combat tournament is held to determine who is the strongest fighter.

The fighter is then chosen to become the leader of the Goketsuji clan.

Anyone who is a descendant of the Goketsuji clan may enter.

Their present leader, Oume Goketsuji, has defended her reign for over 60 years.

To all entrants, an attendant named Kuroko is assigned to take care of all their needs.

Once again, the present leader, 78 year old Oume, will attempt to defend her title.

However, this time around, Oume's younger sister Otane, who ran away from home years ago, has also entered the tournament as well and she seeks to defeat Oume so that she can gain control over the Goketsuji clan.

Only the strong will survive this fight!

Overview:

The Power Instinct series (often abbreviated as PI or GI for short) is renowned for its more humorous take on fighting games, its music and its often-weird characters.

One of the innovations unique to the series was the introduction of the transformation feature. Several of the characters can change their appearance and fighting style by simply executing certain moves (usually a throwing move), though this has not been featured in every entry in the series. Other features include the ability to perform a double jump and attacking while dashing.

Gameplay:

The game uses a four button layout, two buttons for punches and two for kicks. Every character has their own stage, attacks and special moves. The special moves are performed via combinations of joystick movements and buttons.

All the stages are wider than they look. When the objects in the corners are broken, the stage itself is expanded upon, making a bigger playing field.

The player will fight against all the characters and, every four matches, will have the chance to play one of two bonus stages. One of them consists of knocking away Kurokos who run into the screen, and the other involves breaking jars tossed from around the screen in certain orders.

When all the characters have been defeated, the player will go on to face Oume, the current clan leader, and once she is defeated, the ending for that character is shown.
