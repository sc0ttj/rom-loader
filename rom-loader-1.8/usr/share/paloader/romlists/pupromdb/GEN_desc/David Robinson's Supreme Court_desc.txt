Play above the rim! In this game, every dribble, pass, foot-slashing run and elbow-pumping fake is real - all digitized from real basketball. 24 different shots from jumpers to slams, unbelievable speed and rim-rattling sound effects make this the tops in hoop-bending action.

Robinson proves his case with two-handed monster slams and awesome net attcks! 3-on-3 or full-tilt tournament action. Pick up a killer squad from a 20 player draw of slam specialists, board crashers and fast-breaking ball stealers. Catch the Admiral's color commentary at the breaks.
