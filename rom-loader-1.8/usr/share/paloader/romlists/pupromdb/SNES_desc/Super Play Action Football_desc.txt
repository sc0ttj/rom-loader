Super Play Action Football is an American football video game developed by Nintendo for the Super NES. It is the follow up to NES Play Action Football.

Although not lacking in quality game play, it was commercially unsuccessful as it faced fierce competition from competitors such as Electronic Arts' Madden NFL series

The goal of the game is to obtain the ball and reach the other end of the field to score a touchdown, while avoiding opponent players who can pile onto the character possessing the ball. If the opponent players do manage to pile onto the character holding the ball, the play stops and the team goes back to the previous line. A quirk in the gameplay allows the defensive player to get an easy sack if they dive with the nose tackle at the precise moment the ball is snapped.
