A twisted, and very well done spoof of Castlevania 2. Basically, you play as a fellow named BBQ as he battles his whacko father. Almost every single sprite in the game appears to be changed, as well as all the text. In addition, many of the enemy and character sprites appear to be ripped from other games. Including such notables as Mario, the Contra guy, and Macho Man Randy Savage! Other oddities including day and nightime being reversed, and many of the undead from Castlevania 2 reappearing as townsfolk! This hack simply must be played!
