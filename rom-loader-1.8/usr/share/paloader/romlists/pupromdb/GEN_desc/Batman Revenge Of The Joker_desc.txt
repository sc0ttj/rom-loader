The Bat is back in blue and grey, so it's Caped-Crusader to you then, not Dark-Knight. Previous Batman games have more in common with the movies, and Dark Horse comic sty-lings which there based, and the Batman franchise in general.

This time it's a platform-er, again, what else would it be? You have to take on thirteen platform-er levels with the usual assortment of pit-falls and hazards, and four non-DC comic related bosses and two encounters with the Joker. Some of the bosses in this game are so hard it's completely ludicrous, especially the final confrontation with the Joker.
