Weatherded and damaged, Thunder Blade returned victorious from its last mission against the renegade troops. But, this was not to be its last flight.

Reorganized with mega amounts of devastating militar electronics and weapons, the renegade troops have once again focused their sights on dominating the free world. From a secret power base in the East, they unleash their deadly troops who will take to land, sea, and air power- fully armed.

But so are you. From the cockpit of this remodified bird, you've got a state-of-the-art defense system at your fingertips. An aerodynamically designed alloy body flies up to 523 kph while a 20 mm Gatling Gun fires up to 4,800 shots a minute. A computer-aided flight system takes you through even the most hostile environments. Don't worry, you're firing cannons and dropping air-to-surface AATM missiles from your skids, so there's no stopping you and the greatest chopper in the sky.

Your objective is to blow the central enemy base sky high. But getting there is easier said than done. There are four stages to this game where you'll encounter cities, deserts, caves, oceans, and refineries. The strategy is easy, shoot straight, be brave, and just maybe you'll get your wings out of this mission. The free world as we know it, depends on you.

Gameplay:

As in its predecessor, the player takes control of an helicopter which is used to attack a group of guerrillas. The helicopter itself uses guns and missiles, and can also air brake. A distinctive feature that also appears in the arcade game is the use of different viewpoints during the entire game; during normal gameplay and when fighting sub-bosses, the game utilizes a third-person perspective from behind the helicopter, similar to Space Harrier, but the camera changes to a top-down perspective when fighting bosses. Super Thunder Blade had four stages of play.
