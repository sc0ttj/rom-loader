Airstrike II takes you back to planet Cyclon, armed with an improved Mark X fighter ship, with the aim of clearing all 5 zones. These are full of tight Scramble-style crevices and tunnels, as well as heat-sensitive missiles, doors which must be blasted out, and enemy ships. You have a laser gun and missiles at your disposal. You have limited fuel and ammo, but this can be replenished by shooting the dumps which contain them (marked F and A respectively). The game is split into five zones (with identical layouts but an increasing amount of enemies, worth more and more points)
