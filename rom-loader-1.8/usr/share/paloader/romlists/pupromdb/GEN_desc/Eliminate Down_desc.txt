Eliminate Down is a Shoot-'Em-Up game, developed by Aprinet and published by Soft Vision International, which was released in Japan in 1993.

Surviving in this game is a high priority because of the very fewamounts of 1ups you can recieve (I've gotten an average of about 3) and the difficulty level of the game.

So rather than focusing on powerups and pretty backgrounds pay the most attention to bullets and enemies coming at you.

When approaching an enemy that takes multiple hits to kill, get as close as you feel comfortable.  You can save a lot of time and easily break clusters of heavily-armored enemies this way; since your guns reload and fire faster when the distance the bullets travel is shorter.

Study the patterns and movements a boss makes before you rush in and try to destroy it.  Most bosses will unprovokedly make a sudden movement or use an attack you are unfamiliar with.

Use the directional guns to your advantage.  When going backwards, use reverse shots, when traveling up or down drops use vertical shots, and use forward system when going forward.

Even though you're heavily protected, try your hardest not to get hit even WITH a shield on.  Shields are very rare and you'll need to conserve them for later levels.
