You have discovered an ancient civilization deep in the jungles of Madagascar. Transported through time, you must explore the magical, mystical world of Xargon. You control the hero Malvineous on his expedition through a strange land populated by bizarre creatures!

Xargon is both an arcade game and an adventure game. You move through the four-way scrolling side-view world, shooting and avoiding dangerous creatures. Along the way, you'll have to solve puzzles and meet up with the giant eagle Silvertongue, who will guide you on your journey.

Trivia:

The Xargon series is collectively titled "The Mystery of the Blue Builders"

In chapter two and three, which is NOT shareware, if you goto the second page of the credits from the main menu, it says "This game is shareware. Please give a copy to all your friends." So they're encouraging us to pirate it!
