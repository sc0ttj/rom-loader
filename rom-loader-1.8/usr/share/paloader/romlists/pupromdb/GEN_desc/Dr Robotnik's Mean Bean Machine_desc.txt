Dr. Robotnik is at it again! This time, he's not stealing little animals, however. Instead, he's been concentrating on the beans in the VERY little-known M?bian town called Beanville, where the beans run free! Dr. Robotnik took them, and it's up to you to save them all!

Directions:

This game is kind of like a Tetris/Dr. Mario like game where you have to match a number of same colored beans in order to gain points. 

There are three modes of play:

In Scenario Mode, you must stop Robotnik's plan for stealing the beans. You face a bunch of enemies throughout 13 stages!

In 1P VS. 2P mode, you and another person go into an all-human Scenario Mode! You can change the skill level, too.

In Exercise Mode, you freely practice your skills. Almost each game like this has one. 

Controls:

A Button: Rotate piece right
B Button: Rotate piece left
C Button: Rotate piece right
Start Button: Pause/Unpause

Hints:

Last Boss in Normal Mode
Select "Continue" in Scenario mode and enter Purple Bean, Yellow Bean, Has Bean (the funny looking orange guy), and Clear Bean.

Make Beans Jump on Title Screen
Press A, B, and C on controller 1 to make "e", "a", and "n" in "Mean" jump. Pressing the buttons on Controller 2 makes the same letters in "Bean" jump.
