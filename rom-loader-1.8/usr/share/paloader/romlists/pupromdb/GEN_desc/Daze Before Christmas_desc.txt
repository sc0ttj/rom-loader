You are Santa Claus. Enemies wish to stop you from making your Christmas run and delivering presents to all the good children of the world.

It is up to you to stop them in order to save Christmas. Even though this sounds like a really basic story, there is one extremely fun differenciation to it. If you drink hot chocolate, you become Satan Claus, or something like that. He sports red horns and looks like a demon, and is invincible. This aspect rules, and it is so warped, it gets 5 points just for the creativity.
