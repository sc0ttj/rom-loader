Street Hockey '95 is a roller hockey game for the Super NES that takes place in an urban environment. Instead of ice, the players play on cement and instead of ice skates, they use rollerblades. Players assemble their squads from nine hockey players who are savvy in the ways of the street. There are six different kinds of urban arenas and five different variations on the "traditional" road hockey game. Street Hockey '95 uses more than two thousand frames of digitized animation; making it relatively advanced for its era.
