In this game, the player takes the role of Pitfall Harry Jr., son of the hero of the original game, who has to find his kidnapped father.

An extra feature in all versions is the ability to play the original Pitfall! (the Atari 2600 version) after finding a secret doorway. The doorway can be found by looking for something that seems out of place. The Sega CD, 32X and Windows ports contained extra (and expanded) levels and other enhancements over the earlier versions. The Windows port was based on the Sega CD version, and made using Kinesoft's Exodus game technology, which was later used to make the Windows port of Earthworm Jim: Special Edition.

On April 13, 2009, the Sega Genesis version of Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure was released on the Virtual Console in North America and later in the PAL regions on May 15, 2009.
