Play as both Rosella and Queen Valanice in this seventh installment in the King's Quest saga. As Rosella seeks the love of her life, Queen Valanice tries to rescue her from the land they have discovered themselves in. Play as each of them in alternating chapters as the story unfolds.

Trivia:

In the Disney-inspired intro, Rosella sings a musical number and is depicted having only 3 fingers and a thumb on each hand. Unlike Disney movies, the opening sequence is the only musical number in the entire story.

In order to release this game in time for Christmas '94, Sierra didn't spend much time on Beta Testing...therefore the game was very buggy and it was literally impossible to finish the game without the patches that were released a few months later. Due to the large amout of bugs and lousy save interface, they released King's Quest 7 Version 2.0 in 1995 which worked faster, was less buggy and the Save interface was enhanced.
