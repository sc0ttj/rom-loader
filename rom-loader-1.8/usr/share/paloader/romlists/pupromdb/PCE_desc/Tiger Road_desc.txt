While out meditating in the country side, your eveil nemesis broke into the shrine and stole the 4 scrolls that tell of the "Tiger" attack. With revenge on your mind, you set out to conquer the 5 levels of Tiger Road in order to get back the scrolls, and beat the cause of all these problems (whatever his name is).

Side scrolling platform game, where you jump and attack your way to victory. Well, that's the goal, anyway.

HINTS:

- Level Select -
At the title screen, press RIGHT,SELECT,RIGHT,SELECT,RIGHT,SELECT,SELECT, then Button I ten times, ,SELECT,SELECT, RUN for phase 2. Enter the same code expect press button I eleven time for phase 3, 12 times for phase 4, and so on.
