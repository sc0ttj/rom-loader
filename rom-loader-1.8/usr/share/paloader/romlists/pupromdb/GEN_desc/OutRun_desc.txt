Featuring an elevated, behind-the-car perspective, a two-speed shifter and a steering wheel that rattles and shakes in conjunction with the onscreen action, Out Run is a high speed racer putting players at the wheel of a Ferrari Testarossa with a blonde riding shotgun. Real-time scaling and gorgeous scenery make the game a graphical marvel. Players race through 5 of 15 timed courses, including Devil's Canyon, Seaside Town and Autobahn. Complementing the breathtaking graphics are three selectable tunes: Passing Breeze, Splash Wave and Magical Sound Shower. Due to the popularity of the game and its rocking music, Sega released an Out Run CD soundtrack. The sit-down simulator version of this raucously enjoyable racer is equipped with a moving, hydraulically enhanced cabinet.
