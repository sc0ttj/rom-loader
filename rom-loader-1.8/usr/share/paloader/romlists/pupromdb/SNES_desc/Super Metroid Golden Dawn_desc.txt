Nearly 7 months in the making, and it's finally finished. Every room has been disassembled and remade, and several areas of the planet bear no resemblance to what they once were.

Walljumping is absolutely required from the very beginning. Other techniques that are required to complete the game are "infinite" single-wall walljumping (only in a couple of places though), single bombjumping, and the midair morph. Some insane crumble block skills are also required. As with most hacks, "infinite" bombjumping is not required.

There's some early difficulty with crumble blocks but if you do have problems, you can try to abuse savestates to get through it and move on to the juicy exploration-based center.

Save states are required because of the lack of save points, they cause bad errors when inserted into this game.
