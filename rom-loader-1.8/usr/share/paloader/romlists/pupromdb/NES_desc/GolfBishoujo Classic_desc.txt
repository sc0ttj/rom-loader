Wow... what a great Golf game not. 

Not that I've ever seen a Golf game that was better than Hal's Hole in One Golf for SNES, but this is crazy bad. I've never played a Golf game where you might have to put 3 times to reach the hole on the green if you're not close enough to it. Not to mention the 16 directions you can hit the ball doesn't exactly make for precision play. I started out good, but ended up 32 over par for the 9 holes. If you love excruciating gameplay with no payoff on the back end, look no furthrer. 

All the while I was waiting for that sexy 8-bit golfgirl to show me some Japanime lovin for my troubles, but alas, no dice. 

Oh... wait..... there it is, I think.... 

Yes! After loading when you're done it looks like one piece of the pink background is available and I can see the Anime girl with pink hair lying down with her eyes closed. Is she naked? I can't tell.... it's just her face. My guess she is, given the other great FDS games brought to us by Hacker International. Guess you got to play and beat my 32 over par to find out.
