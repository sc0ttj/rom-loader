Rantou Hen (or if you like saying a mouthful, Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun: Bangai Rantou-Hen), is one of those usually-ingenious Technos games. Technos. You know. The River City Ransom people.

Anyway, this is the classic-formula beat-em-up. In fact. it plays a lot like River City Ransom. Excpet there's less plot, and there's no weapons for you to pick up. And it's not very challenging. You can probably beat it in one sitting, actually. You see, the enemy never really warms up to the 2-on-1 strategy. You know, the strategy where Thug B sends Thug A after you (usually because Thug A owed him some Colt 45 or something). While you're beating on Thug A, Thug B picks up a bike chain or something and whacks you with it. Unfortunately, the Thugs in this game never get that smart. But, the game makes up for its easiness with ultra-violence. For Christ's sake, you can jump on people's throats. How many beat-em-ups let you jump on somebody's throat? Everyone go play!

Translation Description:

Well, there wasn't much to translate besides the opening, but that's alright. One interesting thing to note was that this is actually the second release Ipkiss made for this, the first was with made-up "homey-g wassup" dialog, for which Ipkiss was immeadiately flamed for on several message boards. But he went back and fixed it, and now he's really cool sk3n3 dude, so it's all good.
