China in 190 A.D. was in a state of chaos. The Later Han Dynasty, which had ruled for the previous 165 years, was rapidly losing the throne. In the lands surrounding the palace, power-hungry generals usurped control, and the Emperor lost all authority over his kingdom.

Yet, these were only the early stages of a great power race that encompassed the country. As rulers clashed and territorial lines were drawn, the struggle to dominate mounted. By 215 A.D. China was divided into three kingdoms: Wei in the North, Wu on the East, and Shu in the West.
