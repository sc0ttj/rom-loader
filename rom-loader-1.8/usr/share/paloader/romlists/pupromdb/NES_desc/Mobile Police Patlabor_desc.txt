Patlabor's an anime. As you can imagine, it involves giant robots fighting things, or something. I don't know, I only saw one episode, and apparently it had nothing to do with the series because it was pretty funny, but it didn't make any sense. And that's my Patlabor story.

This game is pretty standard FDS fare, you walk to the right and hit things with your sword, uhh, I mean your police baton or something. Or if you don't like your baton, you can always just shoot them. Haha, kinda funny if you think about it!

Also there's a whole bunch of powerups that I don't know what the hell they do.

Translation Description - 
This game of course uses the famous Kitsunefont that, while it might not have been made by him, has at least been mainstreamed and popularized by him. Must be a pretty good font, I reckon.

Not much needed translating (it's a crappy FDS sidescroller for God's sake), but it's there and in English and stuff. There's a bug in the text when you restart a level after continuing, but it's not a big deal. Bleh.
