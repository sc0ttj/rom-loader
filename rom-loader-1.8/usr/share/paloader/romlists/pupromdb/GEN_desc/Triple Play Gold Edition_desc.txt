Think you've got the speed and power to play with the big leaguers? Go for the gold with this ultimate edition of the popular TRIPLE PLAY series for the Genesis. Featuring the complete set of MLB teams and rosters (current circa opening day of the '96 season), Gold Edition has enhanced AI and smoother gameplay than its predecessors. New pitching control interface allows you to get the most out of your aces, and a brand-new Pro mode provides high-stakes challenges. Six different modes in all ensure a massive gaming experience, and you choose how long you want your season to last. Draft, trade, and create any players you can think up, but you'd better hope that the game's incredible hot and cold streaks aren't too much for your rookies to handle.
