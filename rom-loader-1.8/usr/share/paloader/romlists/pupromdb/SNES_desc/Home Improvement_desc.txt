One day, Tim "the Tool Man" Taylor, was doing a show on power tools. And after pulling a few puns on Al, he had to go and get the tools. But there was a problem. When Tim Taylor went to go get the tools, they weren't there. Tim began accusing Al, but Al didn't know about any robbery of any sort. All the thief left was a note that said "If you want your precious tools back, you have to go back to where you belong - the stone age."

Tim grabs his own tools, and he's going to go out and rescue those power tools.
