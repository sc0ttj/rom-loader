When oceans are threatened, only Pond has the guts to save the day! From plugging oil tankers to rescuing mermaids, no mission is too dangerous. He's fearless, he's daring, he's ozone friendly!

Gameplay:

"James Pond" is (obviously) a parody on the famous agent 007 stories. You control Pond, a fish-like creature, who has to complete several missions, while making his way through levels full of dangers and hostile creatures. It is not a typical "jump and run" game: instead of breezing through large levels, Pond has to complete unique missions for each game area: free hostages, detonate a structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit a level only after having completed the objective. Many missions are timed.

Hints:

- Open Exit Door -
At the title screen, hold down C and Left, then press Start. While you're playing the game, hold down A, B, and C. Then rotate the control pad in order to open the Exit door.
