A forgotten bit of history has come back to haunt the Earth and all her space bases. In 2101 a Space Exploration Team was sent out to search the farthest reaches of the galaxy for new life. The news of their launch was lost in the breakdown of communi-cation between the world's most powerful nations. War was declared and the resources devoted to tracking the Space Team were diverted to making nuclear warheads. The last communication from the Space Exploration team came from beyond Venus..."Help us! We have lost engine power. Help..." The rest was lost in static as the first bombs began to fall.

It took years for the dust to settle. Out of the ashes emerged an Earth unified in peace. Expanding technologies gave man the power to live anywhere in space and shortly thereafter the planets had frontier colonies. The Earth Defense League was formed to protect these colonies and the mother planet. At the heart of the defensive movement was the ASSAULT SUIT... a twelve foot tall armored battle machine with awesome fighting capabilities.

You joined the Earth Defense League as a buck private. Now you command an ASSAULT SUIT WING at Jupiter's Ganymede Base. Your name is Rex and you are a master at assault suit combat. And your special skills are being called for because a new enemy is attacking Earth and all her bases!

Little is known about their nature or purpose. Only their name, Chron, and that they fight with lightning fury! Your mission is to protect the interests of Earth and discover just who the enemy is. If you can defeat their evil power the Earth will be safe. Fail and all will be doomed! So gear up your Assault Suit. Load your weapons. It's battle time!

Gameplay:

Much of the games mechanics fall in line with a platform game. Depending on how well you performed in the previous stage, you are rewarded with more weapons and ammo in the next stage. The game features 15 weapons, which was considered a lot of firepower for a platform game in the early 90s. Adding accessories like shields, armors and hover packs, the game adds replay value depending on what you bring to battle.

Trivia:

    - The game is labeled as one player, however you can control the enemies with the 2nd player controller.

    - Upon finishing the US version of Target Earth, the very final credit roll screen will show the Japanese name "Assault Suits Leynos".

    - Unknown to the common public, Target Earth received a prequel that went by the name of Cybernator. Cybernator was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment system, which was one of the reasons why the games may have been considered separate entities. The true game names made more sense though, with Target Earth's being "Assault Suit Leynos", and Cybernator's being "Assault Suit Valken". Although the American names were different, the games possessed a lot of similarities. Much of the mecha and technology seemed to have similar roots, as did the gameplay mechanics. Both games were also story driven by way of text being displayed at the bottom of the screen entailing conversations between characters.

Target Earth and Cybernator shared a number of common themes:

    - Both featured variable weapons systems that the player could equip while on the fly. Additionally, there was 360 degree (or close to it) aiming, and the ability to engage in aerial or Zero-G combat.

    - The enemy in both games was predominantly colored green.

    - Both games offered mission briefings and interaction/involvement with NPCs (Non-Player Characters). This helped to convey the notion that the Player was involved in an actual war, and wasn't so much a one-man army. Although simple in nature, the support of friendly mecha or a fly-by made by friendly aircraft served to help with immersion.

    - Both games pitted the protagonist against a formidable nemesis who would plague the Player until the final level.

    - The ending of both games brought about the destruction of the player's Assault Suit.

    - There were a number of instances involving similar levels: Zero-G combat culminating in a battle with an enemy artillery-ship, a free fall drop to Earth with the Player fighting the enemy on the way down, Zero-G combat pitting the Player against massive enemy warships, underground assaults on enemy bases to destroy heavy/secret weapons, a final battle involving a confrontation with the "nemesis" and later the "political leader" of the enemy forces.

    - Certain scenes in the U.S. versions of both games were censored: in Target Earth, the scene where a comrade doesn't make it back to the ship (and burns up in the atmosphere) was removed. In Cybernator, the scene where the enemy commander commits suicide after his defeat, was cut.

Hints:

- All Weapons -
Do not collect any bonus weapons or destroy anything except the ship at the end of the first level. Your score after the level is completed should be more than 2,800 points.

- Control the Logo -
Press A + C + (Left or Right) on the second controller at the logo screen. Use the D-pad, A, and C to change the size and rotation of the logo.

- Invincibility -
Durind the game press Start on controller two and you should be invincible

- Nine Lives -
Begin playing the game and get past level 2. After it's over, enter the options screen and press Start. A woman will appear and say ''Continue Up'' to confirm correct code entry. This may be repeated at any time if your lives have dropped below three.

- Two Players -
Wait until the first green alien appears on the right side of the screen in the first level. Press Start on controller two. One player can control the normal robot while the other player controls the enemy robot.
