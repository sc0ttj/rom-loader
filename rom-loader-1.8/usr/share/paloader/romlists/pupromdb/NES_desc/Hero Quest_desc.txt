Hero Quest is a port of the Atari ST game, which itself is based on the 1980s Milton Bradley board game. Features some great tunes by Neil Baldwin. No cart has turned up yet, but the game is available for download on the internet, albeit in incomplete form. The distribution plans are unknown; though developed in the UK, the game's music is formatted for NTSC.
