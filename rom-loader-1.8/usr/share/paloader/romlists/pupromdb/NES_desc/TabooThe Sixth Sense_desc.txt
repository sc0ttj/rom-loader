Taboo is a simulated Tarot deck. Pretty simple stuff.

Directions - 
First the game asks for your name and birth date and gender. Then you get to ask a question, and in typical Gypsy style it gives you a bunch of vague stuff about the cards and the final result is like a fortune cookie with no cookie. Oh, you're supposed to 'influence the shuffling of the deck' with the directional pad. This makes it more personal. Really.
