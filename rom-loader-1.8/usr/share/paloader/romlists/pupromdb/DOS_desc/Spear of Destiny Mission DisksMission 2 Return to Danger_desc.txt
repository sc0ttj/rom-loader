An expansion disk released both as a standalone floppy version and bundled with the original Spear of Destiny in the Spear of Destiny Super CD pack.

This add-on continues the story of the Spear. Jump into the shoes of "B.J." Blazkowicz once again and go into 21 new Wolf levels with new, more detailed textures, as well as new bosses and enemies, such as machine-gun toting bats. Other additions include improved sounds and some minor gameplay adjustments, for instance the inclusion of crushed rats as indicators of secret doors, new prizes to get, etc.

Note that this mission disk was neither developed nor produced by id Software, and was instead a licensed title.
