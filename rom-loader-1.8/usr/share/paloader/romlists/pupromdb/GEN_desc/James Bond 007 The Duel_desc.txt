Overview:

James Bond 007 - A name to strike fear in anyone foolish enough to cross him. Now he's back, in a brand new adventure especially for Sega. Four frantic levels of fast and furious action await you! What are you waiting for?

Gameplay:

You are James Bond 007 and you must stop a crazy professor who has the same old dream as everyone else. World domination. You have your trusty Walther PPK and you must go through a few levels with a villian at the end of every level. Such as in the first level, at the end you get to fight Jaws. To put it simply this game is basically a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. You can find women who will give you an extra life, and many other things.

Trivia:

The Duel is notable among Bond games for a number of reasons. Although it was released 4 years after Timothy Dalton's last outing as James Bond (in Licence to Kill) his likeness is used in the game, most notably the opening screens (presumably as Dalton was still under contract to appear in future films), thus making it Dalton's last appearance in a Bond game to date. It was also the final Bond game to be released by Domark, who had released a series of Bond themed games beginning in 1985 with A View to a Kill.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it was the first Bond game not to be directly based on a movie or novel. Instead it featured an original storyline, albeit one featuring familiar villains including Jaws and Oddjob. Though The Duel's storyline was not its strong point, it did blaze a trail for future licence-holders EA, half of whose Bond output would be based on original storylines. One previous Bond game, the Delphine developed, The Stealth Affair, included an original storyline but the game was originally based on a generic Bond-style character named John Glames and only had the licence added for its U.S. release.
