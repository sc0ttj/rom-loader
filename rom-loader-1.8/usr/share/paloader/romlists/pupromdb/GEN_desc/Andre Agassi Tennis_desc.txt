Andre Agassi is my all time favorite Tennis player. I have watched a lot of Agassi vs. Sampras matches in my day. That is why when I saw this game I had to try it out. I found out that just because your favorite name may be on the cover, doesn't mean that the product is going to be as respectable as the athlete.

Andre Agassi's face appears right at the beginning of the game. Bringing back memories of his old hair do. Sadly, this is the best graphics the game has to offer. Playing the actual game is very tough on the eyes. The players look terrible. The graphics are really blocky and the crowd reminds me of the ol' nintendo day crowds. The Worst part about the graphics is the choppy gameplay. You're going to be all over the place. Emeril couldn't chop this much. This makes it near impossible to place a shot where you want it to go.
