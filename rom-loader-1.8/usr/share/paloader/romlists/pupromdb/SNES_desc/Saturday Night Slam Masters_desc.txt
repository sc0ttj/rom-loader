It's not all that bad of a game. It lacks a great deal of content and material, but it was a nice attempt by capcom to enter wrestling. Many of the characters have some sort of tie to Street Fighter or Final Fight. Haggar makes an appearance and Biff refers to Zangeif if defeated. That is enough to keep you entertained. The music is sort of catchy until you hear it repeat it's self again and again. It can be an annoying reminder of how difficult the game is or how bad you are at it. It also lacks any plot and maneuvers. Basically hitting one button repeatedly will win a match. Keep in mind it was difficult to make a wrestling game at this time, with no detail, graphics, and many of the buttons we have now (X O [] /\ Anyone?) However the game did remind me of Smackdown VS. Raw being on the Market. All in all if you like fighters, especially arcade style, you'll enjoy this.

A 6 out of 10

Directions:

If you have ever played a wrestling, beat'em up, or fighting game in your life you know the directions to this game. Simply beat down your opponent using an array of attacks, jumps, and grappling moves until their health bar is completely diminished, then go for the pin. Make sure your not too early or that no one is around to kick you out of the pin. Hit the 3 count and become the champ, after defeating everyone on the circuit. A classic Street Fighter like game, maybe that's because it's made by capcom?
