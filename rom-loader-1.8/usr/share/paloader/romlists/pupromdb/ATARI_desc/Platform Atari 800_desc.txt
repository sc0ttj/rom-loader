You are now the proud owner of the one and only REAL darts game around.  180 has 8 different opponents waiting to take you on, in a two player option for when your friends want to join in and a practise game to help you win when they do!  Against the computer you'll play in a Championship knockout (coming in at quarter final stage) and to carry off the tournaments you have to beat three opponents.  The game selects who you'll play and in what order at random each time so that every game is different.  Regardless of which of th e8 characters appear and when, they will get better as you progress towards the final.  Each of the players has his own style of play, with "favourite" doubles and finishing technique.  Working this out early in a match can often help you win through.

The practice game, which we suggest you try out first, is there to help you become more skilful at throwing the darts.  There is (very) little luck in 180.  To win you need to have a good eye and complete mastery of the throw.  Practice is against the clock.  You have to hit each number in sequence, from 20 down to 1, in a limited time.  Easy it is not, but it is a lot of fun and it will develop your skills for the big match!

Action Biker was commercially tied-in with the KP Skips potato snack range, and features its Clumsy Colin mascot prominently. The task is to rescue Marti, who is trapped in one of the 150 houses which make up the forced-perspective 3D world of roads and buildings in the game. 

Colin is on his trusty bike, which must avoid oil slicks, other traffic and contact with walls, but can pick up Skips for an energy boost. Many of the buildings you can enter have nothing of interest, but many have upgrades for the bike. The most important of these are the headlamps you need so as to see into the darkest area of the game world.

Part of Codemasters' original budget-price range, this pinball game aimed to put fast & furious action first.

The table design features extra flippers on both sides, which are at the bases of sections of features. The best scores can be achieved by repeatedly bashing away at sections of blocks.

The essential theme of the table is of magic and wizardry, with the targets to be lit including the word 'MAGIC' as well as a weather potion and a magic cottage. Trapdoors must be shot open to get their bonuses, then shot shut again to prevent the ball being lost in them. Extra balls are offered every 10,000 points.

Adventure Creator is a fairly simple adventure game creator/editor. You can create rooms and hallways, with treasure chests, monsters, and traps that must be avoided. Games can be saved to disk, but you need the Adventure Creator cartridge to play them. Adventures can also be automatically randomly generated.

The games you create are fairly limited, with only one monster allowed per screen, and three types of weapons to hobble the monster with. The goal of the adventures is to find some named object. However the object you seek is really only a name, and is not represented graphically.

Adventureland was the first of the Scott Adams text adventures. Using simple two word commands you explored an enchanted world trying to recover 13 lost treasures. 

The game's display was different from other adventure games like Zork in that the screen was divided into two "windows": the room description, exits, and items appeared on the top part of the screen, and you entered commands on the bottom of the screen.

Trivia:
An Adventureland Demo package was released in 1979. It is a sampler of the original game, brought to the market as a retail demo. As a cut-down version it contains 3 treasures.

http://www.mobygames.com/game/adventureland
This is adventure #2 in Scott Adam's text adventure series. In this adventure, you shuffle between three locales: an unremarkable (at first) London flat and two islands littered with dangerous critters and people. The goal of the game is to find the two pirate treasures on the treasure island. You move about and use objects by typing one or two word commands such as NORTH, INVENTORY, or GET SNEAKERS. You only have to type the first 3 letters of a command or object for the parser to recognize it.

Trivia:
Scott Adams published the BASIC source code to Pirate Adventure in the December 1980 issue of BYTE Magazine (pp. 192-212); the code sets up the virtual machine for the adventure and then largely consists of DATA-statements, thousands of numbers plugging values into the virtual machine. With this (somewhat obtuse) reference, many text adventure fans among BYTE's subscription base reverse-engineered the virtual machine and used it to help get a leg up advancing their own homebrew text adventures.

This is adventure #3 in Scott Adam's text adventure series. It takes place in a nuclear power plant. You must race against time to fulfill your mission or the reactor may be doomed. You use one or two word commands to move around and manipulate objects.

Trivia:
When a certain TV show going by the same name as this game threatened legal action, AI was forced to changed the name, hence the vast array of names seen for this game. Because many boxes had already been printed with the now-illegal name however, rather than just junking them, they rather comically covered up the old name with a horribly ugly gold sticker with the name Secret Mission on it. Apparently this was enough to satisfy the lawyers...

The Count of Monte Cristo was eventually consumed entirely by his drive for revenge. Count Cristo, on the other hand, is merely the victim of a Voodoo curse an enemy hexed him with... an external plague more possible to reverse. Starting the game standing over his coffin, you wander the length and breadth of his castle in pursuit of a recipe and the verbal and material components needed to cast an antidote to counter his occult menace. It contains good-luck charms, the sorts of mad scientist chemical concoctions that might well yield a Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation, a flighty medium and her crystal ball, and no small quantity of juju, useful for all sorts of voodoo applications. All that and a chimneysweep trapped in the flue! The player will navigate all these and more with the trademark Adventure International VERB NOUN two-word text parser.

The old frontier town is long since deserted, but thirteen treasures can still be retrieved from the deceptive stillness of its closed mine and Boot Hill. Uncover secret passages and navigate a certain supernatural undercurrent using your VERB NOUN text parser as best you can while riding a bucking bronco, cracking a safe and learning the ropes from the spirit of a long-dead shaman.

You awaken in a sealed wing of the Count's Transylvanian castle, seemingly restrictive but yielding further avenues of secret passages and unexpected exits to the intrepid and timely explorer. Over the course of a few days you need to cultivate a familiarity with the layout of the castle and the nocturnal activities of its primary resident, who chooses to make midnight snacks of you rather than a main course. An unpredictable day/night cycle forces your hand, necessitating finding a reliable light source and some means of staying awake -- or else you awaken the next morning back in bed, your possessions pilfered by the kleptomaniacal creature of the night and your neck boasting irritated bite marks. Each day you must incrementally approach your goal of overcoming the Count, lest you wind up as one more dried-out ap?ritif.

Strange Odyssey is the sixth game of the Scott Adams text adventures series, marketed by Scott's company, Adventure International. It is an old-style text adventure sporting a two word parser and split screen interface.

You play a space traveller whose space ship breaks down while orbiting a remote asteroid. Starting with only a phase pistol, space suit, and shovel, our mission is to collect 5 alien treasures and link back up with your mothership.

Number 7 in the original Scott Adams adventure series. This one takes place at an amusement park. The first puzzle is how to get in past the turnstyles! Once inside, you must solve the mystery of the place, going through a house of mirrors and so forth. It is an all-text adventure like the others in this series, with a very basic 2-word parser.

Number 8 in the Scott Adams adventure series. On an Egyptian treasure hunt, you find yourself deep inside a recently discovered pyramid. Find all the treasures and escape alive! This still uses the same simple 2-word parser as the other ones in the series, and is of moderate difficulty.

Savage Island is the only multi-part game in Scott Adams' adventure series, all of which have a very similar parser and interface. At the completion of this game, players receive a password which allows part two to be played. The Savage Island games are also probably the most difficult adventures in the series!

The player begins trapped on a small remote island in the ocean, which is facing a hurricane and also has an active volcano. The player can cross a river, and will also need to explore a cave network. Items are often found by running through the sand with one's hands. 

The island holds a great secret, which will not be discovered until both parts of the game have been completed.

http://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-8-bit/savage-island-part-one
The second half of Savage Island, this continues exactly where the other game leaves off. It includes a mysterious code sheet which you will be able to decipher upon completing the game, revealing the ultimate secret of the island.

Number 13 in the Adventure series from Scott Adams, and the first which was never released in all-text format (except for BBC, Electron, Dragon and TRS-80 versions). Solon, the Master Wizard has lost the 13 Stars of Power. It is up to you, his faithful apprentice, to retrieve them from Claymorgue Castle.

This is similar to the other SAGA games in the series. Additionally, there is some use of magic of course!

Yes, after purchasing diamond mines in South Africa, oil wells in Saudi, and rare beer cans in Walla Walla, Washington, I had begun to wonder as to what other trendy commodities remained to be added to my swelling portfolio.  Then a snip of a ticket girl dared to tell me (ME! Hartley J. Wormsflather III!) that my flight was overbooked.  To avoid future misunderstandings, I bought the airline.  I think I'm onto something profitable here.

Enter the intriguin world of high finance where even the sturdiest of corporate empires can dissolve as quickly as it's built.  Airline is a no-holds barred strategy game for one to four players.  The object is to construct a sizable empire while competing against human and/or computerized opponents.  Players purchase landing rights from any one of 36 major U.S. cities, buy planes and then station them on routes that will maximize the players' revenue from fares.  And unlike many strategy games, the outcome of Airline is soley determined by your playing skills.  That's right, no random element is involved -- meaning no untimely upsets or surprises!

Do you enjoy great sounds and colorful graphics?  Super, because Airline does it right with a multi-colored display area and a full array of sounds to match the pace of the game, all you add are yourself and an Atari!

Airline something different from Adventure International!

Planet Cyclon's military force is centred in fortress Gemini. They are overpowering your people in an ongoing war - only one of your nimble and pacy Mark V fighters is intact. It seems like the only hope is for a skilled pilot such as yourself to make a solo attack on Gemini, using your laser cannon and Quark bomb to devastate their installations and ships.

Gameplay replicates Scramble, being viewed side on with gradual scrolling. You infiltrate the cavernous system, avoiding contact with the spiked walls and gun turrets, or with the many ships and bombs they scramble to block you. The final challenge is to shoot an airlock open, with an accurate central shot. You must pass through it several times, with more and more enemies each time.

You have limited ammunition and fuel, and use fuel more quickly when travelling faster. Fortunately, the cavern has many supply dumps, whose contents of either fuel (F) or ammo (A) can be stolen by shooting the surrounding shields centrally.

Airstrike II takes you back to planet Cyclon, armed with an improved Mark X fighter ship, with the aim of clearing all 5 zones. These are full of tight Scramble-style crevices and tunnels, as well as heat-sensitive missiles, doors which must be blasted out, and enemy ships. You have a laser gun and missiles at your disposal. You have limited fuel and ammo, but this can be replenished by shooting the dumps which contain them (marked F and A respectively). The game is split into five zones (with identical layouts but an increasing amount of enemies, worth more and more points)

Wriggle him through wriggly shapes, squoosh him through squooshy shapes, zig-zag him through zig-zaggy shapes.  That's rubbery, bouncy, true-blue ALF! But be careful!  The Wufflegumps are lurking in the tunnels, trying to block ALF's path. You'll have to be clever to get around them. If you can get ALF safely to the color room, his special music will play and he'll do a dance for you.  Taking on all the colors of the rainbow!

A rather simple, yet original, vertical space shooter. You control a small space fighter tasked with extermination of hordes of alien spaceships. At first, different slow moving motherships attack you in four separate waves. When hit they release two smaller but much faster moving shuttles. To progress to the next attack wave the player must shoot down both the mothership and the two shuttles capsules while evading getting hit by either. 

In later stages two motherships will appear on the screen at the same time and their movement speed will gradually increase. The game loops endlessly until the player runs out of lives.

One of the earliest 'Software Toys', Alien Garden is set on a scrolling planet consisting mainly of 24 clusters of crystals, representing flowers. You control an embryonic life-form and must ensure its survival and reproduction through up to 20 generations.

Through trial and error, you must find which of the crystals are food, which of them grow when you sting them, and which of them are fatal to touch. Depending on this, you can use either your tail, stinger or wings to make contact with them. Every time you boot the game, the behaviour of the crystals changes, emphasising the need for experimentation.

The remnants of an Alien Race have from time to time descended upon Sol III to mine rare crystals deep within the planet and unknown to the surface dwellers known as Humans.  The crystals being harmful to the Aliens in the raw state require that slaves be taken from the surface to mine the raw materials.  Many Alien guards inhabit the highly sophisticated complex with their wondrously refined crystals used in a technology unheard of to Humans.

The unstable nature of the environment deep within the planet presents a constant threat and hazard to all beings in the complex.  Flaming fire balls, fire and sulphur pits abound.  Above all, a hideous beast roams the deserted and ancient mining tunnels cutting off a small section of the complex.  The Beast is such that even the Aliens prefer to avoid it.

You as a Human have been enslaved to labor in the crystal mines forever.  Outside of your well-guarded prison room you have only heard rumors of the possibility of escape.  Within the complex, in well-guarded chamgers, exist refined crystals with strange powers that can assist in your escape to the surface.  The adventure begins as the force field guarding your cell begins to flicker due to a change in Sol III's magnetic field.

Alley Cat is an action game consisting of several mini games cleverly tied together. You're a little black cat who wants to make love to a pretty lady cat that lives in an apartment complex. Play all kinds of cat-themed mini games in order to reach her and score as many points as you can while doing so.

You start out in an alley and need to get inside the apartment by climbing on garbage cans and a fence. Next, jump on a clothesline and through several open windows while big dogs try to eat you and people throw garbage at you. Outside of the apartment complex you can score points by eating the mice that run across the clotheslines. Once you've jumped through a window you enter a room where you play a randomly assigned mini game.

These mini games include: eating all the fish in a fish bowl, stealing milk from a bunch of bulldogs, pushing a birdcage from a table and eating the bird, catching mice inside a big cheese, pushing vases from a cabinet. To make things harder there's always a broom inside every room that tries to knock you around. You score points by completing the mini games within a certain time (the faster the better).

After you've completed a mini game you're back in the alley. Make your way back inside the apartment complex and you get a chance to play the love-cat game: try to reach the lady cat on the top row of hearts while rival male cats and cupid's arrows knock you down. After you've mated, the difficulty gets cranked up a notch

Deep in the darkest depths of space, there lies a Base Station. Not just any station, but one which sustains the Alpherions, the most feared space raiders of all time.  For years brave men and women from the farthest reaches of our galaxy have tried to destroy this evil outpost.  All have been repelled by the base's ingenious pulsing Alpha Shield. But not you, you have a plan! You have calculated that, at just the right moment, you'll be able to zip through a break in the shield and attack the Alpherion Base.  You have learned that, when under attack, the base will withdraw part of its electrifying force field to conserve energy.  That should give you enough room to deal with fireballs. Heatseekers and any other deadly projectiles the Alpherios may let loose. So strap on your seat belt and get ready for an action-packed trip to the Alpha Sector.

Alphabet Zoo is a top-view game where the player races around a maze, avoiding enemy creatures.

Your task in this isometrically viewed game is to clear the city of Amaurote of the many bugs and insects which have invaded it. You are supplied with an Arachnus 4 ship and 5 million units of cash. 

There are 3 different types of ants - drones, queens and scouts, each representing their real function in the natural world, so queen bees are the most lethal opponents as they generate new ants. Money must be spend on buying improved weaponry (including that needed to destroy the Queen Bees) and repairing the ship throughout the 2500 screens Amaurote is depicted in. As your main weapons are bombs, you need to consider their bounce and distance before firing, to avoid being caught up in stray explosions yourself.

The object of the game is survival. You gain points by moving the ant with the joystick from the colony to the food on the surface and back to the colony. However, when the ant breaks through the surface, he exposes himself to the deadly anteater. The ant is armed with five deadly eggss that explodes seconds after the fire button is depressed on the joystick or the ant may manuever the anteater under a falling rock.  The ant moves faster than the eater when travelling in tunnels so you can adjust your distance for laying the delayed eggs by retracing your steps. You have three ants at the start of the game. Returning all four cubes to the colony completes the set and gives you an extra ant. On the 2nd set, you must evade two eaters and on the 3rd set, three eaters.

A strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, each compete on a board
divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares or by removing all opposing pieces from the board. However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat.  If the combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus. On a light square the light side gains an advantage. Some squares color also changes over time.

The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lazers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

Asteroids is a conversion of the popular arcade game. You are the pilot of a spaceship trapped in the asteroid belt, and you need to blast your way out! Each time you shoot one of the asteroids, it will break up into smaller pieces. Eventually the pieces will become small enough that they can be destroyed. When all asteroids have been fully destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round. Just in case the numerous asteroids didn't cause you enough trouble, a pesky flying saucer will appear from time to time and try to shoot your spaceship with torpedoes.

As pilot of a spaceship, your job is to save the planet Earth! Eight mega mines are slowly homing in, and you need to destroy them all before they reach Earth. Trying to stop you are a variety of flying saucers which will constantly be chasing you around the planet.

Your ship is equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy enemy saucers and the mega mines. Located throughout the space around Earth are eight shield depots; if you fly through one of these, you will temporarily become invincible. Your spaceship also has a limited energy supply; if you get too low on energy, it can be resupplied at one of the generators located in the four corners of the play area. When all of the mega mines have been destroyed, you will move on to the next, faster chase!

The lost city of Atlantis is under attack! Wave after wave of Gorgon vessels are approaching, each armed with weapons capable of destroying a part of the city. You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to defend it from the invaders. The various gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been destroyed.

Trivia: When the city of Atlantis is destroyed, and the game is over, a blip can be seen leaving the ruined city. This blip is the Cosmic Ark, a spaceship carrying the survivors to other worlds...and this game's sequel.

The object of the game is to destroy the tartillian structures in each sector; each structure scores 5-99 points. Each sector cleared scores 77 points. Each subsequent ship passing a cleared sector scores 99 bonus points. A score of 10,000 points gives you an extra ship. By moving the attack ship off the left edge of the screen you will proceed to the next sector. Moving off the right edge allows you to wrap around to the left side. You must destroy all tartillian defenders that attack you before you can advance. For single player the 1st joystick controls the movement of the attack ship when the fire button is not depressed and controls the targeting cusor and laser blasts when the fire button is depressed. For two players the first joystick is the plot's controller which manuevers the attack ship and controls the shields (the lyso-blast weapon cannot be fired when shields are activated). The 2nd joystick is the gunner control which manuevers the targeting cursor of the attack ship and fires the lyso-blast weapon.

Aztec is an Indiana Jones type adventure game featuring our hero's quest to recover a valuable Jade Idol from a maze. Armed with only three sticks of dynamite and a pistol, our hero must get by traps, animals (lots of snakes and panthers), and natives, and find a way to make it out alive.

The value of the Idol is set on the level of difficulty and declines as the game progresses. Thus, the player is awarded with the speed of which a successful recovery can be made. Multiple commands allow for freedom of movement, and expand the adventuring side of the game. The animation used several frames for each creature.

Although the game is somewhat easy on the lower levels of difficulty, the game appears impossible on the highest of the 8 skill levels. The creatures in the maze increase in number and speed, and tend to want to follow you around more. This is difficult however if you want to go to the lower level and there's a hungry jaguar waiting for you.

You walk around exploring boxes and "trash piles". Sometimes a box contains something useful such as a machete, pistol, bullets, dynamite, a health potion, or the idol. Sometimes it contains skulls or bones, or even nothing at all. 

The game features some unusual traps. You can walk into a room and the walls start moving in on you, or the ceiling starts dropping on your head. If you don't make it out in time, your toast.

When you die, you have the option of restarting using the maze you just died in. That way, all of your exploring is not wasted.

In B-1, you have to "fly" a B-1 bomber to it's destination, and destroy the target of the mission. 

You input text commands to control your bomber's altitude, course, radar, weapons, and so on. And, of course, the USSR will try to stop you from bombing their targets, with an arsenal of MiGs and SAMs, and they are dealt with by the use of electronic counter-measures, evasive actions, or by shooting them down.

The game ends when it reaches a logical conclusion, either by deploying your bombs and getting far enough away, returning to base, or being destroyed. After this, you get a short summary, and an option to play again.

A simple race game simulating off-road buggy racing in the Baja California desert. The game uses pseudo-3D perspective and behind-the-car view. As opposed to most of the racing games of the period, collisions with other buggies cause slowdowns rather than crashes. Other notable features include a speedometer and a race progress indicator. 

From the technical perspective, the game uses Display List Interrupts (DLIs) to create multicolor horizon and 3D-road effects.

At last! The ultimate baseball game for your Atari 400/800 home computer. Baseball gives you individual player control, fully detailed animation and a scrolling outfield on home runs. Choose from a full range of pitches and try and outwit your opponent. Revel in the adoration of a hysterical crowd as you hit the winning run in the bottom of the ninth  Baseball is far superior to any video baseball game you may have seen!
Based on the 1986 Walt Disney animated movie, the story revolves around a mouse named Basil who lives in the basement of the famous Sherlock Holmes residence 221B Baker Street. Basil's friend Dr. Dawson has been kidnapped by the villainous Professor Ratigan and he must search through London for clues that will lead him to the fiend's lair.

The game is a colorful platform adventure through 3 locales: London's shops and docks, the sewers and finally the den of Ratigan. In each area, 5 clues must be found by exploring objects such bags and sacks, cans, jars and chests found in each screen with Basil's magnifying glass. He must pick up clues to fill 5 pockets in his coat and then he will be able to determine if some are fake (as Ratigan has scattered 8 fake clues among each locale). Fake ones must be dropped until all 5 real clues are found then you get a clue to the level exit to go to the next locale. If you can't find the exit, each clue can give a hint as to what direction you should go in. 

Your energy runs down as you go through the multi-level platform screens and encounter Rattigan's goons but some objects will contain cheese which restores energy or mousetraps which when laid in path of the goons will make them harmless (though they take up a pocket until used).

Beamrider is a 3-D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!

Big Bird is ready to play Hide and Seek! Children help him by inviting their Sesame Street friends and making them hide as they practice concentration, memorization and sequencing important pre-reading and pre-math concepts. To begin your child invites three muppet friends to play Hide and Seek. A touch of a key on the EasyKey sends them scurrying around the funhouse to hide. When the music stops and their muppet pals have found their hiding places, your child has to remember where one, two, and finally, all three are hiding! Subsequen game levels increase the challenge and keep your child guessing. When your child finds all the hiding Sesame Street muppets, Big Bird will skate around the funhouse and salute your child for being such a good seeker. If there is a mix-up Big Bird will offer a musical or visual clue to encourage your child to try again.

Everyone on Sesame Street waits for Big Bird and Little Bird to bring the morning mail. Children make choices to help their feathered friends make the right deliveries to the right places! As your child helps Little Bird make his rounds, he or she matches each picture package with the store in which it belongs. He or she can experiment with different possibilities while playing. Does the car go with the bus or with the egg? Do the shoes go with the tree or with the socks? By pressing one of three keys on the computer keyboard, your child tells Little Bird the right answer. When a round of play is complete, all of the stores on Sesame Street light up. If there is a mail mix-up, the shopkeepers gently point out mistakes and encourage your child to try again.

Few people even remember, much less have actually seen a Blaster arcade machine.  This unique 3-D shooting game was actually the unofficial sequel to Robotron: 2084 (set in the year 2085).  Unfortunately the powerful 3-D graphics used in the game made it very expensive to produce, so only a few hundred were made (estimates say around 500).  Another problem was that while Blaster was gorgeous to look at and fun to watch, it was a very difficult game to play.  Few players were skilled enough to reach the end, and as most arcade operators know, overly difficult games don't make much money (such was Gravitars fate).  The odd 3-D style graphics also tended to confuse people and scare away potential players (this was 1983 after all).  This is a shame because games like Blaster and I, Robot were really ahead of their time.

It is worth noting that the screenshots on this page simply don't do the game justice due to the inability of a still picture to capture unique 3-D movement of the objects. 

At this point you're probably thinking that Blaster is just another great looking arcade port for the 5200 right?  Wrong!  It was actually the arcade version that was the port!  As hard as it is to believe, the Atari 400/800 version was the first version of Blaster to be developed.  Vid Kidz was so convinced that the Atari 5200 was going to become one of the greatest systems of all time that they developed Blaster for the Atari 400/800 while they waited for the 5200 hardware to be finalized and released (400/800 code was easily ported to the 5200).  However once they showed their prototype to Williams, Williams decided that the wanted to do an arcade version of Blaster because "The arcade version always came first".

After the arcade game came out and met with modest success, Vid Kidz went to Atari with their prototypes to work out a deal.  Unfortunately by this time it was 1984 and the video game market was crashing fast.  Although Vid Kidz finally worked out a deal, Atari decided not to release the game due the weak market.  The really sad part of all of this is that the 8-Bit version was ready back in 1983 and could have been a huge hit for Atari had Williams not demanded that the arcade game come first.  

Blaster is a first person 3-D shooter seen from the cockpit of the Blastership.  Although it may look odd and confusing, the the controls couldn't be simpler.  Pushing left or right will move the ship left or right, and pushing down and up will cause the ship to climb or dive.  Since the game is seen though the cockpit of the ship, you will see the whole screen move in response to the controls rather than seeing a ship move around a stationary screen.  This can make avoiding obstacles a little difficult since you can't exactly tell where your ship is, but the game gives alot of leeway in this department.

The game is separated into four different stages: The Robot Grid, Time Tunnel, Outer Space, and Planetoids.  Each stage has its own unique characteristics, but the goal of each stage is the same: shoot anything and everything that moves, rescue all humanoids, and avoiding losing all your energy.  After clearing all four stages, you will be returned to the Robot Grid and the difficulty will increase.
 
[Robot Grid]
This is the first stage you'll encounter and is arguably the best looking of the four.  The Robot Grid plays a bit like Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, in the fact that you must move through archways while shooting all enemies that get in your way.  While it isn't absolutely necessary to pass through each archway, doing so will net you massive amounts of bonus points.  The first archway is worth 1,000 points, and each successive archway is worth an additional 1,000 points.  However if you miss an archway the bonus will be reset back to 1,000.  Robots can be similarly chained for large bonus point payoffs (starting at 100 and increasing 100 points with each robot).
As you weave your way through archways while navigating the plain you'll also run across walls.  Walls are transparent grids that are reminiscent of the obstacles in the trench scene of Star Wars: The Arcade Game.  Avoiding walls is rather difficult as they take up a large area of the playfield, but it is absolutely necessary as they take off a large portion of your energy if hit. Starting on level 2 Kamikaze planes will attempt to ram your ship at regular intervals.  The closer the ship is when you destroy it, the more points it is worth, but be careful that you don't wait too long...

[Time Tunnel]
The stage is reminiscent of the Time Warp stage from Gorf.  Here you must maneuver around the time tunnel in an attempt to save as many humanoids as possible.  These humanoids are from a 20th century starship disaster and have been stuck in the time warp for a millennia.  The first humanoid you rescue is worth 1,000 points, and each successive humaniod is worth another 200 points (up to a maximum of 2,000 points).  Missing a humanoid will reset the bonus value back to 1,000 points. Thankfully there are no enemies on this stage so you are free to concentrate on collecting humanoids.

[Outer Space]
This stage is similar to the Robot Grid, but there are no annoying archways to fly through.  Unfortunately there are a ton more enemies on this stage, making your trip much more difficult.  There are four different types of enemies, each enemy type poses a unique threat.
Xitan Mineships  Xitan Mineships are tricky little buggers.  They like to buzz your ship at high speeds and then throw a barrage of deadly space mines in their wake.  Avoid these mines at all costs! 
Z-15 Fitershipz  Z-15's are your standard attack ship and will confront you directly with lasers blazing.  On an interesting side note, the Fitershipz look suspiciously like Tie Fighters... 
Destructor Satellites  Destructor Satellites are large four paneled objects that appear at the most inopportune times.  These fast moving sentinels take up such a large portion of the screen they are quite difficult to avoid.  Take special care to avoid their deadly laser barrage when taking evasive action. 
Death Riders  Death Riders are the absolute deadliest enemy in the game.  These deadly creatures (which resemble a skeleton riding a rocket) pack some serious firepower and they aren't afraid to use it.  If they fail to penetrate your shields they will attempt to ram you at high speeds.  

[Planetoids]
This is the final stage of each level.  This stage is similar to the Time Tunnel, but this time there are deadly planetoids and saucers to avoid.  There are two different types of saucers that hide in the planetoids: Purple Saucers simply move about the screen taking pot shots at you, but Red Saucers will attempt to ram into your ship.  Red Saucers can be shot at close range for a large bonus and chained for an even larger bonus (up to 3,000 points).
As you navigate the planetiod field you will eventually hear a beeping noise, this is your cue that the Energizer is near by.  The Energizer looks like a large glowing E and is hiding somewhere along the rocks.  Touching the Energizer will instantly repair your ship and warp you to the next level.  You may eventually notice that all the stranded humanoids in this stage make a path that leads right to the Enegizer, so it's in your best interest to try and rescue them along the way.  Missing the Energizer won't cause you any harm, but it will make the next level more difficult.

Blaster is an amazing piece of programming shows that the 8-Bit computer line was capable of great things when properly programmed.  Blaster may not have had much success as an arcade game, but would have been a sure fire hit for Atari if it had been released when it was originally finished in early 83.  Unfortunately management bureaucracy once again reared its ugly head and ruined another great game.  Thankfully we can all now enjoy one of the greatest lost games of all time.
The first of Blinky the ghost's three outings, the ghost with the most has to progress through a series of levels and remove the hazards left by ghost-busters (who aren't called Peter, Egon, Winston or Ray for licensing reasons). He does this by collecting the right objects to cast the all important spells.

The levels themselves scroll sideways and are layered with platforms. Making the task difficult are spiders, mice and the like - watch out in particular for the jumping frogs. Once the appropriate spells have been cast (involving lots of back-tracking to collect objects and bring them to the cauldron) the objects to make an underwater diving suit must be obtained.

For those who know nothing of World War I or it's heroes, this game is named after Max Chatsworth, one of Britain's Flying Aces. Chatsworth's fame began in battle, when he was out on a reconnaissance mission, and his squadron was decimated by enemy planes. The pilot survived, and in the process shot down seven enemy fighters. He shot down thirteen more the next month. For these actions, Germany offered their Blue Max medal to anyone who could shoot Chatsworth downand Chatsworth got a new nicknameBlue Max.

As Blue Max, you go out on sortiesflying missionsattacking assigned targets. Targets include bridges, buildings, enemy planes, tanks, bridges, anti-aircraft batteries, vehicles and ships. You progress to new missions as you take out your targets.

You must drop bombs to take out the ground targets, and this action also represents a key danger for you. Unlike the modern bombers that drop bombs on targets far below, early aircraft engaged in semi-suicidal bombing runs. The pilots started at high altitude, then tipped the planes nose downward towards their ground-based target, and pulled up before they hit the ground. In the middle of the dive and pull up process, they released the bomb. There were problems of coordination, found in the game as wellif you time it wrong, or start too low, you will crash.

This game has aroused some controversy too, which supposedly caused it to be banned in Germany. In the course of your missions, you end up bombing houses.

In this sequel to Synapse's Blue Max, it is the year 2001 and you are flying a flying saucer. You're trying to bomb enemy targets while not getting shot (or rammed) by enemy saucers or shot by ground cannon. If the screen border starts flashing yellow, you are dangerously close to the ground. If the border is red, you are hitting the ground. If the border is gray, you are flying low but not TOO low. If the border is light blue, then the enemy ship is a the same altitude as you.

This is an overhead-viewed racing game similar in style to Super Sprint. There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.

There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.

Rockford the Ant returns in another Boulder Dash adventure contains 15 new levels, in addition to the easy-to-use game editor. Players can build, save, and play their own levels. The software includes a feature to sequence your levels on a separate game disk.

All of the elements and hazards from the previous Boulder Dash outings are back: The fireflies, butterflies, growing amoebas, enchanted walls, and of course, the boulders. New features include titanium (indestructible) walls, growing walls, and slime that allows boulders and diamonds to drop through it at a varying rate.
Final Release
....
Bomber Attack is a real time fast action game that puts you in command of a supersonic bomber over enemey terrain.  You can see the enemy's factories, airstrips, ammunition dumps, and missile installations stretched out below your flight path.  Secured in your bomb bay are 25 ten-megaton superbombs.  YOUR MISSION: Drop all 25 bombs on key locations before the enemy can down your bomber.

But watch out for Red Cross hospitals as neutral ground, they're protected by the Geneva convention.  Pilots who bomb enemy hospitals are in for serious trouble.

As you try to complete your missions, enemy missile fire intensifies.  And unless you knock out the airstrips, an enemy fighter plane will take off and dog your bomber, atching you maneuver for manuever.  If you're a real ace pilot, you may be able to climb above and out-maneuver.  If you don't you'll have to attempt to complete your mission while dodging his fire.

Hit?  Don't give up!  As you pile up points, your crew is working to repair any damage.  You may have to land with a crippled bomber, but at least you will have a chance to fly again and complete your mission.  Three direct hits will send your plane plummeting to earth with the lives of your crew unlikely to be spared by the crash.  Fortunately, the first one hundred points you tally, and every 200 points thereafter, cancels one enemy hit.

Bomber Attack has three skill levels so you can start out as a trainer pilot and graduate to an ace.  "Pull up your flaps", you're off into the wild blue yonder leaving a wake of destruction as you zoom into immortal fame as a modern day fighter pilot.

You're Rockford and have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds. In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.

Trivia:  Boulder Dash was so popular on the home computer that it was ported to an arcade version. Usually, it is the other way around; in that a popular arcade game gets ported to the home system.

http://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-8-bit/boulder-dash
In part two of the "Boulder Dash" series, game design hasn't changed compared to part one, so you still have to mine diamonds while avoiding falling rocks and cave monsters of all sorts. As in part one, later levels become more difficult because many puzzle elements are added.

A port from the C64 version.
Tunnel through alien underground, blasting through boulders, eluding spreading green fungus, dodging nuclear rods or BOOM, you're a fossil! Trapped! And all you have to escape this alien underground is your rotating auger, a few bombs, one day and on night. Those boulders you see, avoid them. They can cost you seconds and consequently, your escape. Watch out! Those probe birds are releasing nuclear rods that explod into creeping green fungus to block your tunnel, or turn you into a fossil. As you forget ahead, pick up every bomb you pass. You'll need them to blast your way out of tight spots. At all times, keep your wits, that auger can turn on you. Sound intense? You've got 98 more levels to go.

This version does tends to lock up.  Use either the 5200 or cassette version.
The object of this game is to paint all the rooms of a building without losing your paint brushes (lives) and before time runs out. You and up to three friends can select from any of eight player sprites, male or female. There are six skill levels with eight buildings per level. After you finish a building, you will be given part of a special message. There are six messages, one per skill level. 

You get from floor to floor by way of elevators. Be sure the elevator is at your floor when you board or you will fall down the elevator shaft. There are also three ladders out of the basement. Watch out for Flying Half-Pints. They will appear on one side of the building at any floor except the basement and will move horizontally across. You must jump or duck to avoid them. 

Starting at building number two, you must also avoid Dumb Buckets. These will walk around and ride the elevators but they always move in a set pattern. Starting on building three and continuing every other building, you have to contend with Brenda, the superintendent's brat. She will put hand prints on your freshly painted walls, which will cost you forty points and require repainting to finish that building. You can grab the candy cane in these buildings and give it to her. This will stop her for fifteen seconds so you can repaint.

Starting with building four, you must beware of the Bucket Chucker. Unlike the Dumb Bucket, he does not follow a set pattern, he follows you. You cannot destroy the Bucket Chucker but there are two ways he can be trapped. One way is to use the paint mixer, a square within a square. You touch it to turn it on for four seconds and if the Bucket Chucker touches it while it is on, he will shake for four seconds. You can turn the paint mixer on over and over while the Bucket Chucker is in it, unlimited times. Another way to trap the Bucket Chucker is to go to the basement, lead the Bucket Chucker to the ladders, go up a ladder, avoiding the elevator, then go left or right. The Bucket Chucker will then be stuck in the basement until you lose a brush.

Starting on building five, you must jump over steam pipes or they will trip you, losing you a brush. In buildings six, seven and eight, your brush will run dry after eight, seven or six rooms, respectively. To refill, simply touch the large paint brushes in some rooms.

The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. 

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. 

On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them. 

There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.

Trivia:

Bruce Lee was voted #18 in the "Top 25 Platformers of All Time" poll in Retro Gamer Magazine (Issue 37).

As Captain Sticky's new crew member, you are responsible for the maintenance of his diving suit.  The Captain's supply of gum has dwindled and now he must recover as much gold as possible to replenish his supply of Stickies (gum, that is!)

On your way down to the seabed mines, you must defend yourself against the creatures using your harpoon gun.  Land on top of a gold platform as the gold bar arrives, and the rope you are carrying will automatically haul the gold to the surface.  To collect more gold as it appears, you must resurface to grab a new rope!  After collecting 10 bars, you will automatically switch onto the next level of play, and once the Captain has completed 8 levels, the next difficulty (Zone) level comes into play.

The Olympics, in the year 2000, feature a new event, the first designed to test the athlete's mind.  A robot is placed deep inside a maze and relays visual information to a computer in front of the athlete.  With the aid of a 3-D view on the screen in front of him or her, the athlete must guide the robot through the maze a fast as possible.  If the athlete chooses, he or she can consult a map and the robot's compass, but this will cost points and time.

The event is called Captivity.

The year: 1502

Your childhood sweetheart and bride to be, Jessica, has been captured by Frederick, Lord of Alconbury and is held in one of the high towers of Alconbury Castle.

Unless you agree to help him in his attempt to overthrow the King, she will suffer a slow and painful death.

You, being a noble Knight, would rather die attempting to rescue Jessica from her "fate worse than death", than to help Lord Frederick in his evil task.

Your plan is this: Climb the castle battlements, avoiding the spear thworing guards and many other objects that block you in your quest.

As you do not know the layout of the castle, you will have to discover the best route to rescue Jessica.  But hurry.  There is limited time in which to save your beloved from what will be an almost certainly slow and agonising death.

YOU MUST NOT FAIL HER!

In Centipede, players control a magic wand that is used to square off against a horde of nasty bugs that make their way through a mushroom patch. 

The Flea falls straight down towards the player, laying fresh mushroom in its path. The Scorpion runs from side to side across the screen, turning mushrooms into poisonous toadstool, which cause the Centipede to behave irrationally and dive bomb the player. Spiders jump up and down towards the player; the closer he is, the more points are earned (300, 600, 900) . And the Centipede makes it way down the playing field. Shooting segments cause the Centepede to split off and form multiple targets.

Shooting any bug turns it into a mushroom, which can block (or speed up) the bugs on the playing field. If any of the bugs touch the wand, it's lose a life until Game Over.

Centipede was created by Ed Logg, and used a trackball in the original arcade version.

The 5200 version of this is far superior.

From volume 1, issue 1 of Antic dated April 1982.
Players control a cock who is making sure that his wife delivers at least one of her children into the world. The cock automatically goes into the back room to mate with his wife, who lays an egg shortly afterwards. After this, it is up to the player to make sure that there is at least one egg among the two rows of nests, and that the egg is not destroyed by snakes, rats, raccoons, porcupines, and the like that are smart enough to climb the ladders leading up to the nests. 

The creatures enter the henhouse from either side, and must be moved along by pecking at them. As the cock walks around the henhouse, its energy will decrease. It must be replenished by eating chicken feed at both sides of the henhouse. Only then will the cock move faster.

Upon entering the back room, the player must wait until one or more hearts appear at the top of the screen, as they indicate the number of eggs the mother will lay. Since there are ten nests, up to ten hearts can only appear at a give time.

When an egg sits in the nest long enough, a egg will hatch out, and the resulting chick will make its way toward the back room, ring the bell outside the door, then go on in. If one of the creatures destroy an egg, or the only egg in the nest hatches out, the player loses a life, and the game is over when all lives are lost.

Choplifter is a side-scrolling action/arcade game that puts you in command of an attack chopper. Your mission: Go behind enemy lines and rescue up to 16 hostages per level. Be careful, though, because tanks and enemy aircraft will try to stop you -- and they won't stop shooting while you are rescuing those hostages!

Originally released for Apple II home computers, Choplifter was later ported to the arcades and a number of video game consoles. Many imitators and homages would follow.

Trivia:

Choplifter! began as a 3D game in early development, but was later converted into a 2D side-scroller when creator Dan Gorlin realized the limitations of contemporary hardware.

Game creator Dan Gorlin cites both the Iranian hostage crisis and the arcade game Defender as major influences on Choplifter!'s design.

Choplifter designer Dan Gorlin on the surprising influence of his game on the industry:

"A lot of professionals in the game business now tell me that Choplifter was big influence on them. It kinda freaks me out; like inventing dynamite or something."

They can't make a better mouse trap, but they can make a better Defender - and they did. Chopper Rescue is just that. It is a fast-moving action game for the Atari 800. The object of Chopper Rescue is to fly your chopper through a maze protected by cannons and flying aliens and pick up all your men before the time rings out.

You start out with a helicopter which can drop bombs or fly straight. You can even curve your bombs, to get at those hard to reach spots. The game is very much like most other Defender games except that the humans you are protecting are completely indestructible. You have to pilot your chopper and pick up all the humanoids before you are moved on to the next screen (there are three different mazes). The opposition consists of three varieties of flying aliens, floating mines and two different types of cannon. The game is extremely tough, your only advantage being greater speed and maneuverability.

This is a terrific game. Its strange combination of Defender's save the humans goal and Berzerk's element of being chased in a maze hits just the right spot. Another great feature is that when you fire a bomb or a missile, it keeps traveling beyond the screen.

In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while avoiding the ducklings. The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong. Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing. The ducklings also eat the corn, however.

There are only 8 distinct levels. The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on. However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders. On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.

Two players each control a "cowboy". A gold bar appears randomly on the screen, and if either cowboy takes it to the assay office at the top of the screen, the goal vanishes and a ten dollar bill appears nearby. Each player has his own bank in which to deposit the money, and after ten bills have been deposited, the player receives a house worth 20,000 points. A second house is worth 30,000 additional points. The two cowboys can shoot each other, the victim going to one of two hospitals in the upper corners of the screen. Following the two cowboys are snakes and tumbleweeds; the snakes follow one cowboy, the tumbleweeds the other. If caught, a cowboy will be paralyzed for a few seconds. However, if he shoots whatever is chasing him, it is converted into whatever chases his opponent: snakes into tumbleweeds; tumbleweeds into snakes.

Collapse is a simple puzzle game where players control Zen the Mole who is presented with a network of sticks that he must turn blue. Zen does this by simply walking over them while he is yellow. To get to the network, he must turn himself red so that he can build bridges that lead to it. Zen's redness disappears after a few seconds and he turns back to his default state. Once Zen has managed to turn the sticks blue, he can unleash the Rotox, a white line that moves around adjacent blue sticks, destroying them once the Rotox makes contact. When all the sticks have been destroyed, Zen proceeds to the next screen.

The blue sticks must be destroyed within a time limit. While the player navigates Zen around the screen, two creatures walk around the screen, trying to make Zen's task difficult. Contact with either of these creatures result in Zen losing 100 units of time. To deal with them, Zen is equipped with some magic dust that he can sprinkle on them to make them disappear and resurrect in their same position that they appear. Extra time is awarded to Zen by collecting jewels that occasionally appear on screen.

ZiMAG doesn't make games anymore but there's still a good chance you could run across this disk in your local computer store's bargain bin. If so, beware - from its alien outtakes cover art to its lame screen graphics, Collision Course is about as interesting and original as Parchesi.

The basic motif here is warmed-over Defender - a good choice, but badly done. Your job is to protect a trio of cargo ships returning home from a five-year mining expedition. All four of you are heading through a particularly dangerous part of the galaxy that seems to be lined with floating mines and killer satellites. Your escort cruiser comes with guns to nail the mines and satellites as well as a shield to protect you from them but the shield time is very limited (about six direct hits will do you in). You're up against a time limit for completing your mission and you must complete it. You've got to make sure that those cargo ships make it home.

Along with four different skill levels, the game contains four different types of mines - well, make that three, since the regular and "Mirus" mines are exactly alike, except for the way they're depicted on the screen. There are also smart mines that try to chase you and accelerator / decelerator "beacons" that speed up or slow down your convoy whenever you hit them.

The gameplay and graphics will make you wonder why you need 24K of Atari computer memory to play it. You've got a very short amount of time to get through all three mine fields and the cargo ships are such big, dumb targets that you can just about count on losing all but one of them (the designer must have counted on it too - you only have to get one ship home to win a round and there's a huge point bonus for getting another one through). Boiled down, Collision Course is your standard space shoot-em-up with all the excitement surgically removed.

Once you're a little skilled at blowing up the mines (concentrate on accuracy), start exploiting the accelerator / decelerator beacons for a high score.

Mankind has established a distant colony, but the area is infested with ants, ladybirds and other parasites, all ready to cut through the perimeter fencing and eat your people's food. As a service droid it is your job to prevent this, and maximise the output.

Achieving this involves a lot of planning and resource management. There are several buildings at your disposal, containing seeds, solar panels, weaponry, fencing and traps. You must plant the seeds, use the solar panels to maximise their growth, and then harvest the finished product so as to trade it. You can carry a gun to take care of the bugs, but this needs recharging frequently, and the location of the munitions store must be determined.

When the bugs break part of the fence, you need to replace it to stop lots more coming through. This can be done more quickly by reducing the compound size, which causes the trade-off loss of growing room.

When the federation was stable the spaceways between all inhabited planets were patrolled regularly by the Space Guard.  New colonies were supplied regularly with food from the established agricultural worlds of the federation until they could produce enough food to be self sufficient and have enough surplus to trade with the federation.

However a war has broken out between the worlds of the federation, and the spaceways are roamed by pirates.  The war and the pirates are preventing supplies reaching dependant colonies anymore.

To these newer colonies established just before the war broke out and all supplies to them from the federation cut off, food is now a priceless commodity.  Their only hope is to conserve the food stocks they have and hope either for the war to end or to become self-sufficient before they arrive.

Unfortunately some colonies are richer than others.. and the pirates know it.  their plan is simple they raid the poorer new colonies of their food supplies and sell them to the richer new colonies.  The pirates have heavily armed ships and know to operate from two large space stations.

All colonies have always been issued with 3 A.D.V.s (Armoured Defence Vehicle) as standard procedure, these now stand as the poorer colonies only protection against the pirate raids.

You are an inhabitant of Colony 7 and a qualified A.D.V driver.

Aimed to tie in with Halley's Comet passing close to Earth, but actually missing the boat by some time, The Comet Game is based on the idea of Halley's comet coming with bacterial life-forms capable of destroying life on earth. As a result, you must get into your high-tech spaceship, intercept the comet, and destroy those organisms. Controlling the ship's autopilot technology, you must ensure that the task is successfully completed.

You must ensure that missile attacks on the ship are unsuccessful (by shooting at the missiles before they hit a your ship, a la Missile Command, controlling a cross-hair that moves around the ship), and maintain communication with Earth, by aiming the comms beam in the right direction to get the best signal. 

Keeping the computer running smoothly requires moving a line of LEDs to match what is being displayed. The fourth ongoing task is to keep the ship's crew happy. This is done in a rather surreal way, by brewing coffee and injecting it into the crew (who are in suspended animation).

The third and final installment in Microprose's Command series of war games simulates five key battles in Vietnam, beginning with the defeat of the French colonial army in 1954 and culminating in the 1972 victory of the Viet Cong against South Vietnam forces. 

Conflict in Vietnam adapts the well tried "accelerated real-time" game system of its predecessors to the jungle combat situation in Indochina, with its bizarre balance of power, specific technology (such massive use of helicopters) and unique strategic challenges. Impressively complex for its time, the simulation calculates a day-night-cycle, weather, terrain, supply lines, formations, unit organization and experience, to name only the most important factors. Two players can compete head to head on one computer, soloists may randomize the enemy priorities in some scenarios for added uncertainty on the battlefield.

Even more so than in the previous games, designer duo Sid Meier and Ed Bever stress the educational aspect of their well-researched historical simulation: the manual is desgined as a complementary read that offers extensive background information to the five scenarios and their 'what if' variants.

Trivia:

The game is dedicated "to the memory of Pfc. Michael John Patrick Callahan, USMC (June 17, 1949-November 8, 1967). Killed in action, Vietnam"

The games theme music is "The Ballad of The Green Berets", a war song of the era.

If Avalon Hill had introduced this game a year or two earlier, it might have altered the course of history. Had President Reagan been able to show this real-time simulation to striking members of the Air Traffic Controllers Union, they might've hustled back to their posts lest a bunch of computerists take away their livelihood.

Seriously, though no present day electronic game can truly reflect the complexities of a real-world situation. Controller comes about as close as anyone could wish. The arcader is given a choice seat in front of a radarscope in a control tower located near a smallish (two-runway) air field. Using the information provided by the 10- and 100-mile radar screens, the player directs the approaches and landings of up to eight flights.

Although Controller, like most of Avalon Hill's computer programs, does not overflow with breath-taking graphics, the display does present a wealth of data in easily decipherable form. The radar display shows each plane's position relative to the tower; a chart to the right of the scope indicates the heading, altitude and velocity of each aircraft in the game, and the section of the screen right below this summarizes statistics such as fuel, bearing and the nature of the maneuver underway for the plane directly under the controller's guidance at the time.

These factors, modified by the flight characteristics of the individual planes, must be rapidly evaluated by the player during every single second of play during the game.

You won't learn, much less master, Controller immediately, but it provides a bracing challenge for those who like games that mix strategy and tactics.

Though it is difficult to recommend Controller to the casual action game lover, it may be just the ticket.

You are a robber whose target is the Acme Diamond Co. and the old mine, both which are full of jewels. Once collected, the jewels need to be returned to your getaway vehicle. Making your job hard are cops who are very smart, choppers who are dangerously low to the ground, and ghosts that can kill you if you come in contact with them. You have one weapon to deal with these enemies, but it has limited ammo. If you get killed by cops or ghosts, you can enter the jail and release one of your captured men.

50 rooms full of treasures await the brave yet thoughtful explorer in this platform game. Using limited thrusting ability, you must collect as many crystals as possible before moving on to the next level. Rooms have multiple exits, leading the player to different segments of the screens.

You have five lives, and will lose one on contact with any of the nasties which move around the screens, or when you run out of time (represented by depleting oxygen). In either case, you are sent back to the start of the screen, but keep any crystals you have collected. Collecting every crystal on a screen earns you an extra life.

In this installment of the Cuthbert Saga, Cuthbert goes for a stroll on a grid. As he walks along all four sides of a cell in a grid, it changes color, and when all cells have been coloured, it is on to the next grid. This would have been too easy, were it not for the nasties that also walk along the grid. Cuthbert's only weapons are his wits and his ability to jump over the nasties. Just try not to jump out of the screen! The inspiration for this game is the old arcade game, Amidar, and it can be seen as a primitive version of Oh Mummy.

In the far distant furture when Earthmen have colonised the galaxy the people of the Cygnus star system have become the most powerful of all.  Intelligence reports suggest that the Emperor of Cygnus is planning to launch an offensive against the Earth, using it as a stepping stone to eventual Galactic rule.

Once it was realised that the Earth people were alone in the galaxy the military might they possessed was abandoned and now only a token peace-keeping force remains.

As the galaxies most renowned test pilot you have recently been evaluating a new experimental police fighter craft.  The Cygnus situation is so serious that you have been despatched to the star system with the new fighter to attempt to return it to Earth control.  To accompilish this you must first attack the city complex on Alpha Cygnus, then disable the industrial planet of Gamma Cygnus and the power planet of Delta Cygnus before attacking the Imperial planet of Cygnus X1 and the Emperor's palace.

Cygnus X1 contains 32 levels of fast blasting action in your quest to save the Earth from domination.

Should you succeed in your mission it is likely that some time in the future your services will be needed again as the Cygnus system, humiliated by your actions, re-arms and prepares once again for war.

Use the joystick to fly your craft across the planets of the Cygnus system as you blast the defences, avoid the airborne mines and try to conserve fuel.  Fuel is used up in ordinary flight, by firing your ion gun, and for shield replenishment after hitting energy towers, alien ships and mines.  Fuel is acquired by flying between energy towers.  Fuel tanks are refilled for every new planet (every 8 levels).

Hints On Strategy:

+ Flying between energy towers is important - try not to miss too many.
+ Don't keep the fire button constantly pressed - you will run out of fuel too quickly.
+ Don't fire at aliens at close range - the explosion will delete your shiled, try to avoid any aliens that get close rather than shooting them.
+ The aliens follow distinct attack patterns - try to learn these and take appropriate action for each one.
+ Some attack patterns are optimised for mine dropping rather than all out attack - don't shoot the aliens during these phases, use the time to collect fuel.

This game is the inspiration, both directly and indirectly, of arcade dungeon crawlers like the The RamJam Corporation version of Dandy, Dark Chambers and Gauntlet.

You, and up to three of your friends, are in a dungeon of monsters. You must fight you way through, gathering food and treasure while destroying monsters. Each time a monster touches you, you lose energy. You can gather food, which can be eaten to restore energy. Once you reach the end of the dungeon level, you descend to the next level down. If you are playing mutiplayer and one of you dies, the other player(s) can revive their fallen comrade by shooting a heart found in the level. If no comrades are fallen and the heart is shot, a monster will appear.

Danger Ranger must collect ten keys from the Chamber of Pasha, whilst warding off the Floating Urns, Radioactive Bats and Roving Eyes. Then he must face the Acid Chamber to collect all the Treasure Chests, avoiding not only the drops of acid, but shooting the four demons which guard the chamber.

Five levels of play. Sound Effects. High speed arcade action game. Full colour graphics. Machine language. Cassette. One or two player game. One or two joysticks required.

SKILL LEVEL

After the title page, you will be requested to enter the skill level, which can be any number from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest). This will keep returning to the hi-score table and title page until a number is entered. If you wish to practice, press the 'P' key. This will enable you to go through all levels without being "killed". Alternatively, press the joystick fire button which will take you straight into the game with the same number of players and skill level as the previous game.

After selecting skill level, you will be asked if you want a one or two player game. If you select two player, you will be given the option of one or two joysticks. If you select one joystick, both players share the joystick in port. If two joysticks are selected, the joysticks in ports 1 and 2 are used by the respective players.

TO START GAME

Once the playing screen is displayed, press the fire button on your joystick. If your man is "killed", press the fire button to continue.

OBJECT OF GAME

Chamber of Pasha (first screen)
Danger Ranger must collect all ten keys (located at the ends of the platforms) to complete the first stage of the game. To do this, he just needs to walk over the key. Listen for the sound which tells you he has picked it up. He must shoot or avoid the Floating Urns, Radioactive Bats and Roving Eyes. To fire his laser gun at them, press the fire button on your joystick and Danger Ranger will fire in the direction he is facing. The centre of the bottom platform will propel him back to the top of the screen if he hasn't collected all ten keys. He may jump the spaces between platforms or fall through them.

Acid Chamber (second screen)
Drops of deadly acid fall from the ceiling and rise from the floor. Danger Ranger's task is to pick up the treasure chests whilst avoiding the acid. Be sure you are far enough to the right to get them (listen for the sound). The chamber is also guarded by four demons which must be shot before he can get past them to the next level. As the game proceeds, more shots are required to kill them.

CONTROL

The joystick controls Danger Ranger's movement.
Up = Danger Ranger will jump.
Down = Danger Ranger will duck.
Left or right = walk or jump left or right.

NEW GAME

Pressing BREAK at any time will abandon the current game and return you to the title screen.

PAUSE

Pressing 'P' when the playing screen is displayed will pause the game, press 'R' to resume.

SCORING

The figure in the top right shows your current score, the one in the top left is the current hi-score. The centre figure is the current level of play and to its right is the number of men you have left. During a two-player game, the current player is indicated below the score.

HI-SCORE TABLE

Danger Ranger maintains a ten entry hi-score table. If yours is one of the top ten scores, you will be invited to enter your initials (max. 3) at the termination of the game.

Darts, by Thorn EMI, is something you play when you want to recover from space games. It's not one of those wonderful paranoid adrenalin-drenching, heart-thumping games. It's relaxing. It's also absorbing and intriguing. It's like - well - it's like a game of darts.

Perhaps darts translate into a computer game so well because it is such an idler's pastime. The game's graphic display helps the illusion. The screen shows a young man (posterior view) standing in a British pub (complete with genuine fake tudor beams). The man, his hand poised to throw, faces a dart board. A graphic inset shows the dart board and a hand. Move the joystick and the hand moves in a similar direction. Pressing the fire button releases the dart.

The game has been played over and over in my household. When two or more people have a go at it, we prefer to leave the computer out of the game. This makes it easier for a human to win. Going one on one with the computer doesn't have to be demoralizing. Just set the computer's skill level at six or above. It's kind of fun to see the computer's hand tremble.
Step up to the oche and enjoy all the fun of competition darts with this program that includes three dart games for the price of one.

Deluxe Invaders is by far the best Space Invaders program ever released for a personal computer. Atari's own,: version was a big disappointment because of the graphics. While they were very good overall, they didn't really resemble true Space Invaders visuals.

Roklan has put it all together.

Deluxe Invaders can be played by one or two people. The invaders drop down noisily from space to begin the attack. The barriers are present and, just like in the coin-op, can be breached by the player. The UFO also appears across the top of the screen as in real Invaders. The player must shoot all the aliens and clear the screen. Then the invasion begins again with the enemy one row closer to the defending cannon. As you all know by now, no one ever wins this game.

Roklan has included some unique game variations to its edition. One interesting idea is that the invaders split into two little aliens when they're blasted by the player. This makes for a totally different style of game. Normal invader strategy goes out the window when this option is chosen. At times there are unusual combinations of large and small aliens in the same row at the same time.

It is clear that the people at Roklan Software really know the Atari well. The sound and graphics routines in this game are excellent.

However there is one slight bug in the program. When in two player mode, the high score is only registered for player number two. This is not a serious problem but it is annoying.

All in all, Deluxe Invaders is an excellent version of the classic arcade game. I would definitely recommend
it.
...
Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.

DESMOND'S DUNGEON

By Edgar Belka

Fiendish Alfonso Schwarz has found the ideal place to hide his plundered gold. He is stashing it in an underground dungeon, a complicated maze of connected passages.

One day, Desmond, out for a walk in the sun, accidentally discovers Alfonso's hiding place. Realising that the vast fortune could all be his, he descends into the dark and dingy depths of the earth to search for the precious metal.

The gold is scattered about the dungeon in bags and Desmond must search for it before carrying it back to the surface. But there are dangerous spiders living in the tunnels, alongside the deadly plungers.

Every now and then, Alfonso flies overhead to drop off some more gold. If he sees Desmond, he will try to bomb him. Can Desmond get all the gold to the surface before the spiders, the plungers or the bombs get him?

3. At the top of the screen are displayed, from left to right, number of re-charges available, score, current level, number of bags remaining, Desmond's strength and the current high score.

4. Each time Desmond is stunned, his strength is reduced. If his strength is reduced to zero, then he will automatically be given another of his re-charge units, if he has one left. His strength will slowly increase if he is not stunned back to 100%.

5. Immediately after being stunned, Desmond is immune to bites from the Spider for a very short period. He is immune only while his figure pulsates.

6. Once you have played several times and reached higher levels, you can re-start the game at the highest level that you reached by pressing the SELECT button. Each time the program is loaded, the highest level reached is reset to one. Then press START or fire to begin the game as normal.

THE GAME

PART 1 - THE DUNGEON

1. You must move Desmond around the dungeon, picking up the bags of gold and carrying them to the chest on the surface. Use the joystick to control the direction of movement.

2. To pick up the gold bags, you just walk past them. To drop them, walk past the chest at the top.

3. Watch out for the plane flying overhead, which drops bombs, eggs and fireballs. If you are hit by one of these, you will be stunned and lose some strength (shown on the strength count).

4. There are other hazards in the dungeon too. Be careful of the venomous spiders which infest the passages, and the plungers which pop up from the floor to make it difficult to move around. These will also stun you. You will also come across flames which will block certain passages.

5. Sometimes it will be helpful to jump over the spiders, flames or plungers. To do this, press the fire button. You cannot jump when you are on the ladders. Everytime you jump, Desmond drops any gold he is carrying. Desmond cannot jump over the plungers if he is carrying gold.

6. When you have picked up a bag of gold, find your way back to the surface and drop it into the chest.

7. Some bags of gold will be hidden behind locked doors. To open these doors, you must find a key and take it to unlock the door. You can then get the gold.

When you have picked up all the gold, you can go onto the Vault.

PART 2 - THE VAULT

1. In this part, the plane is dropping bags of gold into the vault. You must pick these up and throw them into the air, to be caught by the grabs which pass overhead. To throw the bags, press the fire button.

2. In the Vault, you must also watch out for bombs, eggs, fire balls and spiders.

3. When you have collected all the bags, you will return to the dungeons which have become more hazardous during Desmond's absence.

4. If Desmond's strength is reduced to zero in the vault, you will have to go back to the previous dungeon to be re-charged. You must survive in the vault before going on to the next level.

The goal of Diamond Mine is to collect as many diamonds as possible from 20 underground shafts. Each is presented as a single screen with corridors and alleyways. Monsters are released at intervals from a Pacman-style hub, these can be shot. The mines are covered in dust initially; until you have walked through an area, a bullet can't be fired through it. Contact with a monster loses all your gems, so the best strategy is to shoot them out first - as most diamonds are down corridors, this can be planned for. You can start from one of 5 different screens.

Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

Draconus is an arcade platformer with adventure elements where the player gains control of Frognum - a beast similar to a serpent or a dragon. His mission is to destroy the Tyrant Beast, an evil ruler of the dark and dangerous world in which Frognum lives. The main weapon in the game is fire breath, but on his quest Frognum will find many magical artifacts and, thanks to those, gain new powers. 

The gameplay is simple. The player just has to explore different screens, incinerate opponents and use artifacts (for example Morph Helix that transforms Frognum into a sea monster, which allows him to swim and fight underwater).

Dragon's Eye is your typical first person dungeon-crawler fantasy RPG in which you are cast as a valiant warrior tasked with saving the land by completing an epic quest. The land in question are the "Seven Provinces" and the quest itself involves finding and retrieving the "Dragon's Eye" amulet before its evil power corrupts the entire countryside.

The game is played from a strategic map view from which you select which area to adventure into, rest and make your necessary equipment purchases. After that it's off to explore the realm and battle all enemies you might encounter from a first-person perspective. Battles are turn-based and you can issue several different orders to be carried out in queue when your turn ends. You can explore the land as you see fit, but beware the time limit imposed by the Dragon's Eye. If you take too long to find it, it'll be the end of everything!

Drelbs is loosely inspired by the paper-based game played on a grid of dots, in which players draw lines alternately, with the intention of forming more squares than their opponent. The similarities end there; in Drelbs you represent the only member of the Drelb race who has not been imprisoned by the evil Trolloboars. Members of the Gorgolyte race and Trolloboar tanks are targeting you.

A set of randomly-arranged lines are already in place, and contact with them pushes them in the direction of contact. Forming a complete square locks it into place, and it turns into either a monster (causing death on contact), a woman (resulting in bonus points on contact) or a barrier. They will randomly change into stairways, which can lead you into a bonus room.

In the vast, starless void beyond the Mnemos Nebula, your desperate struggle has restored some measure of control after the devastating effects of an ion storm. Just creeping along at sublight speed, you discover that your crew of droids has suffered phase inversions to their programming elements. Once friendly, helpful and benign, they have become an all too real nemesis to your safety and control of the ship. Just when you were sure you had them all safely locked in their service cubicles, the alarm on level 4 sounds to tell you that the life-support systems have been deactivated. As you rush to reset it, you barely escape the deadly grasp of one of the berserk droids. Firing as you dive for the safety of the transfer shaft, the flash of your integrator beam teleports the droid back to its cubicle. But in the face of time needed to recharge, will you maintain your advantage? Will engineering systems be next or weapons control or communications? Good luck, it's 55 light-years to the neares repair base.

Drol is a platform game where you play a cute robot that can fly and shoot. Your goal is to rescue children that are wandering around each level. The levels consist of rows of platforms, with gaps which can be jumped through to go up or down a vertical level. The creatures to avoid and shoot vary from strange hopping, beer-belly aliens, to demons, snakes, and axes flying through the air (we never do find out who's throwing those axes!).

Like Defender, Drol incorporates a "radar" at the top of the screen, so you can find the children and dodge incoming baddies.

Trivia:
The author, Aik Beng, only credited himself using his two middle names. His full name is Benny Aik Beng Ngo, the brother of Tony Ngo. Drol (and Bandits) were independently developed and then published through Sirius and Br?derbund, respectively. Benny Ngo developed Drol while he was attending college. In fact, in the early days, quite a few games were developed by students then published through companies such as Sirius, Broderbund, Sierra, etc.

Dropzone was the first game to propel Archer Maclean to stardom. The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.

Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. 

The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. 

The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. 

On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. 

The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health.

Ducks Ahoy! is a simple game, taking place in Venice. On the screen you see some houses, the canal and the beach (on the top). The player is in control of a boat which can carry 2 ducks at the same time. The ducks start to walk around the houses slowly getting to the exit where they just jump out into the open no matter if there is a boat waiting for them or it's just water. The aim is to catch the ducks with the boat and deliver them to the beach. To make things more difficult there's a hippo in the water swimming around (always where the bubbles on the surface are). If the hippo catches the boat the player loses a life. After 10 ducks are delivered to the beach they start to sing and the the game restarts, increasing the difficulty by making the ducks faster.

In 1982, Atari created E.T. for the 2600, which notoriously turned out to be one of the biggest flops in videogame history.

One might be tempted to think that E.T. Phone Home is simply a translation of that awful game for the Atari 8-bit computer systems. However, it turns out that E.T. Phone Home is a completely different game than E.T. for the 2600. 

That's not to say that there aren't similarities, because there are. 

In this game, you play Elliot. You have to search your neighborhood for pieces that ET wants to build his transmitter. Depending on the level, you may or may not need all the pieces to complete the game. It's also possible to communicate "telepathically" with ET to get a reminder of which pieces he is looking for.

As Elliot looks for the pieces, he is pursued by a number of men who are trying to stop him from completing his task. The game ends when Elliot gets enough of the pieces.

A strategic turn-based wargame for the Atari 8-Bit computer line. Eastern Front puts you in charge of the German armada as they start their infamous Russian campaign, or as it was known at the time "Operation Barbarossa". The game is played from an overhead scrolling map that encompasses the entire eastern European theater, and from which you select your units and issue orders based on their action points and strength which are defined by their appropriate control zones. Isolate units, and their strength starts to go down proportionally.

Only 1-player mode is supported against an AI that actually processes its moves between turns, giving out finer solutions the longer the player takes to make his moves.

Trivia:

Eastern Front was released in 3 different variants. The first two were a 16 KB cassette version and a 32 KB floppy version with improved graphics. Both for the Atari 400 and both developed by Chris Crawford and released through Atari's APX (Atari Program Exchange), a semi-independent label which sold bare-bones releases mainly developed by independent programmers. Some APX games became so popular that eventually they received the full Atari treatment and got an "official" release. This is what happened with Eastern Front, which received its third and final release in 1982 for the Atari 800 in a 48 KB floppy version with improved AI and additional difficulty levels.

Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.

This is a battle on three fronts. You are the captain of the ship Legacy. Your ultimate goal is to destroy the Warmongers' missile bases but you must also protect your cities.

You begin the game in command mode. You select your other modes with the joystick. Up for navigation, down for torpedo, left for sea-to-air and right for sea-to-land. 

Navigation

In navigation mode, you will see an overhead map of the world. You will note that there is a black dot in a black circle. This is you and the circle represents your effective range. You move the circle about the screen to target ships or known missile bases or to refuel at a city. You use fuel only when you are in navigation mode. When you are within range, or if an enemy ships comes within your range, press the space bar to return to the command mode then change to the desired mode.

Torpedo

If you are within range of an enemy ship, switch to torpedo mode. In this mode, you will use the scanner at the bottom to line up your target. Move out of line to avoid a direct hit. Beware of war ship as they will chase you and have the most firepower. Hunter ships will also chase you. While their firepower is not as high as war ships, it is still fairly good. Intelligence ships have the weakest firepower and will not chase you. They can be found on the right side of the screen. If one is destroyed and there are any hidden missile bases, there is a eighty percent chance a hidden base will be revealed.

Sea-to-land

If you want to destroy a missile base or refuel, enter sea-to-land mode. To refuel, get near a city then enter this mode. When you are in sea-to-land mode, you will know you are within range if you see "Dock for refueling" on the screen. You then place the cross hairs on the base of the city and wait for refueling to complete, unless you or a city are under attack. Do not use the fire button to exit or you will fire on your city. To destroy a missile base, position your cross hairs using the scanner on the screen until you are on a missile launcher then fire. Be advised that when you fire on a missile base, they will shoot missiles at a city.

Sea-to-air

If a city is under attach, switch to this mode. You will control a weapons satellite. Use you joystick, or the trak-ball , if you plugged one into port 2, to aim at an incoming missile and press fire to blast it. If it gets past you but has not reached your city, you get a "Refocusing" message and the view switches to a short range view where you will get one more try.

Be warned that ships can attack you no matter what mode you are in. On the easiest level, there are no hidden bases nor do you use fuel.

The Maladroid forces are attacking the Earth with everything they've got. It's your job to stop them. "STE" (Space to Earth) Missiles are being launched just seconds apart. Maladroid fighters are raiding the Earth, pausing only to re-arm and re-fuel. As each one destroys its earthly target it drains energy from the Earth. If your Destroyer's protective shield is hit by gun-fire from a Maladroid Satellite or Fighter, energy is lost from you Destroyer's energy supply. If either energy reserve level becomes critical, you must seek out and destroy a Maladroid Base to regain energy.

If there were any doubt as to the quality of Flight Simulator II, it should be dispelled by the knowledge that SubLOGIC went to the FAA for approval of its use in flight training. Whether or not they actually got the approvalremember this was 1984, and such application of personal computers was new groundthey attempted to create a realistic flight simulator.

This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-23-181 Archer II. For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates Learjet 25G twin engine jet. 

The simulator was considered to be a second generation product. It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details. SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program. The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode. These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.

Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace. In this game your plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen. The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.

This game is one of Paul Norman's first creations. You are in the middle of what is called the Forbidden Forest. You go along in a game shooting various enemy creatures that are in the forest. At the end of the game, you are fighting the mysterious demogorgon, that is in the shape of an owl when nighttime falls. Choose from four different levels of difficulty.

The war with the Kralthans is on, and they've taken prisoners. These people must be rescued from the Draconis caves and the Crystaline caves that are located just outside the Kralthan main command center, Fort Apocalypse. The Fort is too powerful to attack directly, but perhaps a single rocket copter, carefully controlled might be able to do what an army cannot. However the caves are narrow and the enemy has still setup impact shields, defenses and Hyper-Chambers within their depths. 

Fort Apocalypse is a 4-way side-scrolling game, somewhat similar to Choplifter. The player takes the seat of a "rocket copter" and can move up, down, as well as left and right. However this helicopter takes time to turn between left and right perspectives, facing the "front" of the screen. While facing the front, the player is able to drop powerful plasma bombs which can destroy heavy weapons and doors. When facing directly left or right, the weapon used is a more maneuverable but weaker interceptor rocket. Displayed on the screen is a "Navatron", which functions as a radar showing terrain and enemies not yet on the map. Prisoners, once found can be landed on top of them in order to rescue them. There are also "Hyper-Chambers", which are glowing teleporters to other Hyper Chambers located on the same level. Fuel is constantly consumed while flying, but can be recharged at Fuel depots scattered throughout the level. There are also separate Landing Pads which will be the point at which a new helicopter is given to the player, should they be defeated in battle. 

Enemies include laser beams, teleporting rocks, breakable walls, self-propelled mines (SPM), armored tanks (which can only be destroyed from their treads), alien droids and hostile robo-choppers.

Treasure awaits, yours for the taking.  But do you have what it takes to kill the guards and escape?  No guts, no glory.  It's a chancy game, and a little bit lonely.  Are you fast enough?

Fortune Hunter is a one or two player game.  After inserting the cartridge and before you push the start button, you may select one or two players and the level of difficulty.

At that point the room will expand on the screen and your foes will appear.  You are armed with a bow and arrow to defend yourself and only have a short period of time to evade or destroy your foe and capture the treasure.

The object of the game is to score points by collecting treasures and destroying enemies.

Fraction Fever is a contagiously exciting learning game!  It has the graphics and fast paced actions of an arcade game, with an important difference: how well you do depends on how well you understand fractions.

As you hop along on your pogo stick, you'll be searching for a fraction that matches the one at the top of the screen.  Spot the right fraction and ride to higher floors.  Zap the wrong ones along the way and pile up points.  But matching fractions isn't as easy as it sounds.  Because the same fraction can be written several different ways.  Will you recognize 3/4 when it flashes before you?

And remember: you need to watch out for holes in the floor, and keep a close eye on the clock!

The higher you go, the harder the fractions get and the faster you have to think if you want to move and stay in the game!

Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards. The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles and alligators, and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points.
 
This one has more music than the parker brother version.

Turmoil rocks the land and the only salvation lies in the magic of the Temple of Apshai. Unfortunately the location of this temple has gotten lost in time. Furthermore, many heros dispatched to seek it have been slain. A legend speaks that only the blood of the greatest hero of Apshai's greatest hero will be able to reclaim the lost Temple of Apshai. Unfortunately this "greatest hero" has also perished. But all hope is not lost, for the wise man, Merlis has found the hero's son, whose blood is still able to fulfill the prophesy. With great haste, Merlis brings the youngster to the dungeon pits and leaves him to fend for himself. It is this youngster's destiny to find safe passage through the 8 levels, each of which contains passage to 99 different areas,

Gateway to Apshai is a top-down action-RPG. As the desendant of a hero, the player starts with basic stats in 4 areas, Strength, Agility, Luck and Health. and basic equipment, a dagger and leather armor. Then it's time to choose a number between 1 and 99 to generate the dungeon. Once begun, the player must explore the dungeon, hidden until explored and revealed. The player can move in four directions and has standard abilities, each mapped to a different control. There are several different actions available to the player. These include: fighting with the equipped weapon, a LOCATE spell to discover traps in the room, a SEARCH spell to discover hidden doors inside of room which would otherwise look like ordinary walls. Players may also use many of the items and scrolls that can be picked up in the dungeon. The treasure can be picked up which include weaponry (swords, bows and arrows), healing slaves, precious items and magical scrolls. Most items are only good for a single use.

The Gateway to Apshai is guarded by an assortment of creatures including snakes, swamp rats, bats and many more. These enemies are only visible when they are in the same room as the player and are otherwise hidden. After 6 minutes and 30 seconds has passed, the player is teleported to the next dungeon, many versions of the game also offer the option to manually leave the dungeon at any time. Dungeons get progressively more difficult with faster and more vicious enemies.

Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route. Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level. Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.

Stealing money is the aim of the driver you play in Getaway!, in an overhead-view city spread across 35 screens. The player controls a car which moves constantly in the direction it faces, unless you hit fire button for the brake. 

Drive over the $ signs, special items (depending on the level they may be hearts, rings or chalices) and white vans to collect money, and return it to your hideout (in the south-east, represented by an H). You have limited gas, but can top this up by stopping at one of the gas stations. As time goes on, you will encounter roadblocks (which cause you to lose fuel more quickly) and stop signs (which take all your cash when you try to pass them).

The police don't take this lying down - their cars (red, blue and yellow) chase you, especially when you are carrying lots of money or have hit a white van. Making contact with a cop car costs one of your three vehicles and takes any money you are carrying - money you have stashed at the hideout is safe. The ultimate goal is to find the three of the special items and then the white van, which leads to an increased difficulty level - with higher police interest no matter how much money you are carrying.

Harry the Ghost Chaser enters the haunted Fairport Manor and wants to drive out the ghosts that settle in that place.

You control Harry on his mission. The game features sixteen screens that Harry must traverse: the attic, the kitchen, the library, the sewers and more. Ghosts roam the corridors and must be avoided or jumped over. The first few times Harry is touched by a ghost, he is not killed immediately, but merely immobilized from the shock. But further attacks from ghosts and also high falls may kill him. Thankfully Harry can defend himself and throw stones at some of the ghosts to kill them. The doors to the next rooms are often locked, so Harry must find keys to open them. The game can be played by one player or two players taking turns.

Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.

You are in a small town in Germany.  Suddenly an earthquake occurs!  The vault in the town's only bank is cracked open and money pours into the earth.  Because of your courage and skill, the bank hires you and your small band of raiders to go under the streets and recover the lost money.  Below the surface, tunnels and sewers are left only partially damaged, but they are inhabited by creatures which can eliminate your team.  Your only defense is your cleverness and speed.  At first, the money are plentiful.  After every trip back to the surface, more appear right below.  But as the search continues, you are forced to look deeper.  Eventually the creatures seem more aggressive.  If you can recover enough money the bank will give you an advance to hire another raider.  Good luck!

Datasoft's The Goonies is one of the most fondly-remembered games in the genre of platform action-adventure-puzzle games for which Datasoft was known (other games included Conan: Hall of Volta, Bruce Lee, and Zorro, all well-regarded classics).

The game is licensed from the internationally-beloved Steven Speilberg film of the same name, in which a motley crew of suburban kids in Astoria, Oregon, must save their homes from being foreclosed upon and find their salvation in a treasure map leading to an old pirate ship in a cavern. However, they must maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, who are also on the trail of the treasure.

The game is divided into a series of eight screens based on scenes from the film, each of which contains unique and creative puzzles that must be solved by coordinating the activities of two of the kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting killed by deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying demon-skull thingies, or other environmental hazards. For example, in one screen one player must wind up and hold a winch that lifts a large stone so that the other player can pass it, run backward on a ball floating in deadly water, bypass a series of three water buckets going up and down that kill you if you do not time your passage underneath correctly, jump to the top of a rail, and slide across to grab the key to the door below -- and all this without getting hit by a wandering bat.

One of the characteristic elements of this series of games is that it was organized more like an arcade game than an adventure game; the game kept a score and a high score, you got a certain number of lives, which would be replenished at certain points or at certain score totals, and there was no save feature. In other words, the game had to be played all in one sitting, near-perfectly, to see the ending. As might be expected, not many people finished these games. (However, nowadays with emulators and memory-state-saving features, this is no longer such a frustrating problem.)

The Goonies can be played single-player, with the joystick button used to switch between the two characters on-screen, or cooperatively, with each player controlling one of the characters.

Trivia:

The Atari 8-bit version was released on both 5.25" diskette and cassette tape. The tape release has different music on the title screen and no demo mode.

Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.

The game itself consists of four levels:
The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship & shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;

The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;

The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;

The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.
Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.

The disk version saves the high score to the disk.

Trivia:

Arcade machine play screens of Gorf can be seen in these movies - 1982's Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and 1983's Joysticks. An arcade cabinet can also be seen in 2006's The Benchwarmers.

Calling it a 'simulator' was a stretch, as with many of Codemasters' titles. In reality it was an overhead-view Super Sprint style arcade racer for 1 or 2 players, similar in many ways to the company's BMX Simulator. 

There were up to 14 circuits depending on the format, which incorporated many underpasses (some of them deliberately unrealistic) and tight curves. There were oil slicks to avoid and points bonuses to pick up.

The cars have slow acceleration but a lot of power down the straights. You are scored based on your overall time and your fastest lap. Lose to the computer car and it's game over.

Trivia:

You can get an idea as to the budget of this game from the semi-attached license. Not Mansell, Prost, Senna or another superstar from the day, but Johnny Dumfries - a backmarker most famous for being heir to a ?15m fortune.

This game puts you in the position of a driver of a high-performance car participating, as the name implies, in races between U.S. cities. Noteworthy features of the game include a multitude of weather and road conditions (fog, snow, road construction), day/night changes (complete with smooth twilight transitions) and the ability to plan individual route to beat competition to the destination.

Additional features, that this game was among the first to boast, are sequential manual transmission, refuelling, traffic and police pursuits. The graphical presentation is pseudo-3D perspective with behind the car view.

Depending on which title you use, and how you interpret it, this game is about a guy who a)rushes in before attacking b)attacks Russians (this was the mid-80s, when the US helped bin Laden do the same), or c)wears a rather goofy hat. One way or another, this arcade conversion arms you with a knife and sends you on a kamikaze mission against hordes of enemy fighters.

There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters

This is an arcade game in the style of Centipede. You control a ship, at the bottom of a grid. Moving toward you in a zig-zag is a chain of pods. The object is to shoot them before they get the ship. As the pods are shot, the dead pod remains on the screen, as a blocker to your bullets. The live pods on either side form two new chains, both moving toward you.

Further complicating the game are two guns outside the grid, shooting at your ship from beneath and from your left side. You are able to move into the grid, toward the pod-chain, to avoid the guns. The combination puts pressure on you, from front, back and the side.

~Source Unknown
The game is "Gridrunner II", as released in Europe, but HES really liked the title of another Jeff Minter game and renamed it.

Attack of the Mutant Camels is sequel to Gridrunner. In this Centipede style game you play a retired captain of a starship, one of those who had won the previous war against aliens. You come out of retirement because the aliens are back, tougher than ever. Thus a second gridwar begins.

You pilot your ship and shoot at chains of pods coming at you. As you hit the pods, they break into smaller independent chains. The aliens seem to have a sense of humor, though. Each pod in the chain coming at you looks like a...camel. Flying camels from outer space.

As you start shooting the camels, you are attacked by guns from the bottom of the screen and from the left side of the screen. Even worse, a human traitor has joined the aliens, and when he appears on the screen, running across the grid on top, the guns get very accurate at shooting you. Luckily you can shoot traitors.

Other twists include deflectors, which turn your bullets and even ricochet them back at you. The enemy fires back too. And as you advance in level, the enemy changes the direction of their attack.

Using the same game engine and structure as Level 9's game of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, the book's follow-up was recreated on computer. The game is an adventure of sorts, presenting you with 18 months of life viewed through the curious, confused and intellectual eyes of Adrian. Each section features a number of challenges, in which one of three choices on what to do must be made. As you play, the aim is to make Adrian as popular as possible by making the correct choices so as to exert a positive impression on Mum, Dad, Pandora, Nigel, Bert and all the rest. The game is split into four sections, which can be loaded individually or in sequence, with the score remaining in memory as you progress through them.

It's not the policy of Computer Fun to review business software, but faced with something as valuable as Gumball we had to make an exception. To call Gumball a game is misleading. It's a decision-making laboratory, a microcosmic simulation of real-life mini-crises, calling for global strategic thinking and a clear grasp of megatrends in the absolute.

Gumball puts you in the role of a sorter in a gumball factory. You must make sure that green gumballs end up in the green bin and blue gumballs end up in the blue bin. You have a quota of gumballs and a time limit. The gumballs roll down from the top of the screen and pass through a dizzying assortment of chutes and conveyors, You control a series of trip-gates which regulate the gumball directional flow and you can also move the bins to align with various gumball spigots.

You are not penalized for letting the occasional gumball fall through the cracks, but don't let a green gumball fall into the blue bin, or vice versa. If you do, the boss comes out, shakes his fist, and in a wild rage dumps your entire bin of gumballs onto the floor. Gumball is a highly imaginative game and a difficult and challenging one at that. To meet your quota on the higher levels before the time runs out, you've got to increase your production speed to levels which the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Gumball Sorters have deemed dangerous, frivolous and wanton. No time and a half, either.

In Gunfighter you play a Wild West Sheriff, whose town is under attack from a group of outlaws who have taken the ownership rights for several homes. You receive warnings of the presence of a particular outlaw, and must patrol the streets shooting it out with them. The Doc's can give you an extra life, at a cost of $500. Red Indians and potholes in the road mean that you have to concentrate on more than merely the outlaws. You are limited to carrying six bullets - enter the Sheriff's office to gain more. A casino sub-game is included, allow you to gamble some of your money.

Description
Fort Defiance is a half completed stockade blocking the path of an invading army that heavily outnumbers you during the War of 1812. You command a lone Napoleonic era artillery piece and its crew and are guarding the weakest point in the forts defenses. Your performance will determine whether the fort will stand or fall.The game is played under a handicap system (from 1-63). The lower the handicap you choose at the beginning the faster the enemy will break and run. The handicapping system insures that each attack which is repelled is followed by a more determined effort. As commander of the artillery piece it is up to you to select the type of ammunition, fuse length, elevation and target.

Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...

Trivia:

True to the role-playing experience, Hacker came with no instructions whatsoever, other than loading instructions. The inside fold-out image reads:




Yet Another Temptation.

It's about the instructions for Hacker. There aren't any. (After all, if you really accidentally stumble into someone else's computer system, you one will be there to help you.)

If you get really stick, we can provider a set of "Hacker Hints." (Details on enclosed card.) However, this is a temptation you should resist, if you can.

Two distinct characters called Mr Head and Mr Heels are played in this arcade adventure. They are separated at the shoulders but capable of joining together to maximize their abilities in some situations (but reduce them in others, so they can be split again).

The game is presented from an isometric perspective, and presents the characters with a number of puzzles involving switches, jumps and climbs. The levels are 3 dimensional, and the characters must collect crowns as they progress. Objects can be picked up and manipulated as necessary.

http://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-8-bit/head-over-heels
When you first play this game, you'll be forgiven for thinking that your Atari's collision detection has failed. The space-suited character you control moves through enemies, walls and other hazards without losing any of his five lives. It also moves past the heart which starts next to you, and even across the screen's borders. 

This is correct; the idea of the game is to use your gas cannon to guide the heart (which represents a clearance pod) from one end of the screen to the other, within a time limit. If this runs out, or the heart hits a wall or any of the marauding enemies or hazards, a life is lost. Controls are rotational - moving the joystick left or right changes the character's angle, while pushing forward causes him to move in that direction, with fire activating the blow-gun.

In this platformer, the player has to guide Henry through the numerous rooms of his house. Each room is a screen-sized level filled with deadly household-items such as toothbrushes, teapots, flying toast or coffee machines. Touching one of these objects or falling from too high kills Henry. The goal of each room is to reach the exit, however, before the exit opens up, Henry has to collect a key and all items that are spread throughout the level. In order for a key to appear, Henry usually has to collect a special item that sometimes adds more obstacles to a room.

Trivia:

As a sneaky way of boosting the game's sales, Chris Murray would move them to the #1 positions of shop's in-store charts. Whether this helped or not, Murray received ?1 per copy on the full-price C64 release and 10p a copy of on the budget Atari release, but made more money from the Atari version (which usually sold at least 5,000 copies a month, perhaps benefiting from a relatively starved market by 1987).

In this game you got to supply energy to a distant planet in danger.  For this purpose redirect, coloured falling balls of mineral elements, into the correspondent colour cup at the end of the ramp.  To do this you can place some arrows on certain squares of the ramp (use joystick and click button to place an arrow facing right or left).  When a coloured ball hits an arrow it changes its path to the adjacent column.

Remember to put green balls only into green cups and so on..  It seems like easy... but some despicious monsters will try to steal the balls.  You can shoot them' up, going on them with joystick button depressed.  At each level difficulty will increase and also the number of cups.  Sometimes on the ramp will descend special shining extra balls.  They can go into any cup, giving extra points.  Hypnotic Land requires skill and quick reflexes, can you manage it?

[game documentation]
International Karate is a simple one on one beat 'em up. The characters are shown from the side, the aim is to beat your opponent using the different karate moves. Depending on the move, the player will get a full or half-point. You need two full points to beat your opponent, or at least have more points when time runs out.

On your journey you'll visit 8 different places spread all over the world, like Sydney, Egypt or New York. At the end of each stage you'll get to play little bonus games.

While beating enemies the player will increase in belts, starting from the white belt.

Trivia:

System 3 faced a lengthy court battle with arcade publishers Data East, who claimed System 3 had ripped off their game Karate Champ with International Karate. It also used the same forward kicking (street) karate style. The game also looked a lot like The Way of the Exploding Fist, but they weren't sued for that.

Pandora's first game combines the Gauntlet style with the World War 2 setting, and specifically the Eagle's Nest building which is being used by a commander as his HQ. Three Allied soldiers have been captured, and you must infiltrate the facilities, rescue your brave comrades, destroy the building, and salvage as much of the stolen art treasures as possible.

There are eight levels to explore, each with a specific mission objective. Some of the paintings are loose, others are in crates which must first be shot. Explosives must be collected, not shot. With limited ammunition, guards everywhere, keys at a premium, and lots of strategic hiding points, an all-guns-blazing approach is less successful than a planned, measured one.

Strategy games with a real-time movement element didn't begin with Dune 2, and this was one early implementation of the concept. Your army has landed on an alien planet and has the intention of destroying their weather control station, and ideally as many of their units as possible.

The action is viewed from above, and you use a cursor to direct units, and automatically target and attack enemy units. Once you blow up the weather control tower, by exploding at least 2 bombs next to it, you must flee the planet ASAP. Protecting all your units is important and requires a tactical overview approach, but the bombs are particularly vital.

Original game by John Harris. "Chuckles" referred to in the title screen is designer Beuche. Not much of a change from the original, gobble the dots in the maze while deadly smiley faces dash across the screen. Use the shifting gaps in the wall to escape them or gobble them when you turn the tides. The label on this game incorrectly calls it Jawbreaker but it's actually Jawbreaker 2. An actual Jawbreaker 2 label is not believed to exist.

Music notes have escaped throughout the world, and Jet-Boot Jack must collect them up. There are ten levels, the first five of which can be played from the main menu. Gameplay is platform-based, and largely involves progressing down the levels, using holes and moving platforms. Enemies hover over the holes, but these can be disabled by toggling the right switches. There are also timing-based hazards such as arrows emerging from walls and lazer beams - contact with any of these costs one of your five lives. You also lose a life if you run out of energy. Some levels vary the format by requiring you to simply collect every note on a single screen, which has regeneration points and one-way platforms.

Cult hero Matthew Smith followed up Manic Miner with a seminal platform game. Having struck it lucky in the first game, Willy now owns a lavish mansion with over 60 rooms linked in a 3D plane, and must tidy it all before his housekeeper will let him sleep.

Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.

Tough guy Joe Blade must rescue six respected leaders from the madcap Crax Bloodfinger, who has kidnapped them in different areas of his base. Along the way he will find six bombs which must be activated, leaving him with only 20 minutes to rescue everyone.

Joe Blade is viewed side-on and uses flick-screen progression. The bombs are deactivated by arranging letters into alphabetical order, but the bulk of the gameplay involves shooting and maze navigation. The screens are linked in various ways, and contain a number of keys which must be used correctly. 

Trivia:

On April 30, 1988, Joe Blade was put on the infamous German index by the BPjS. For more information about what this means and to see a list of games sharing the same fate, take a look here: BPjS/BPjM indexed games.

As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 1995 is an unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved.

As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute.

There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.

In Journey to the Planets, you play a spacefarer who must find a way to return to his home planet. To do this, you need to collect various treasures from several unexplored worlds. Sometimes you will need to shoot your way to a particular treasure; other times, you will need to solve a set of puzzles to reach your goal. Once you recover all the treasures, you must pilot your starship through uncharted space with a limited amount of fuel and find your home planet.

The 1983 cartridge release features a different soundtrack and tones down some of the more difficult puzzles.

The evil Akuma has destroyed your homeland, killed many of your friends and kidnapped your Princess Mariko. Fortunately, you are skilled in Martial Arts, so your inevitable quest to reach Akuma's palace has a chance of success.

The game is viewed from the side and features a succession of increasingly-difficult opponents. All the standard karate kicks and punches are available to both you and your foes. The game's design was serious and realistic, and the game featured lots of cutscenes to develop the story.

Trivia:

'Akuma' the name of the evil warlord in Karateka (and many other games featuring a Japanese bad guy) is a Japanese word that roughly means 'devil'.

This is a collection of three mini-games designed to drill in some basic reading and typing skills to the young microcomputer user of the early '80s. The first of the three games (each with four skill levels, demanding faster reflexes) presents the player with falling letters which must be typed correctly before hitting the bottom of the screen... and eventually the game's mascot floats down defying the player to type in an entire word. The second game takes word-typing as a given skill, as the player is now in charge of typing in the full names of icons of common household objects gradually floating down the screen. In the third game, an object is named on the bottom of the screen and the player must punch in the correct number corresponding to the object's icon, displayed on screen.

The second and third games have bonus rounds whose gameplay is as the regular rounds, except that the icons are now partially obscured, demanding a certain exercise of player memory faculties.

You play as a techno scavenger in the year 2049, exploring the Koronis Rift, in one of Lucasfilms earliest games.

The Ancients abandoned the planet, leaving behind many different artifacts and ships, which you can loot. Send your droid to retrieve modules and try to figure out what the ancient technology is for. It could be batteries, shields or even weapons, to help you fight the trigger-happy saucers that want you dead.

The game uses fractal graphics, the terrain is vast and detailed, and the story behind it is quite complex, considering the type of game.

Your civilization is under attack, and it's down to you and your Laser Hawk helicopter to put things right. Destroy the five bases belonging to Proc Irata. They have sent their full fleet of ships to intercept you - shoot to destroy, and avoid those bullets. The centres are increasingly well-defended, with bombs, missiles and meteors among the threats. Many upward-shooting ground targets are destructible, but beware of the trees they are interspersed with. You have limited fuel, but fuel stocks hang through the air - contact with these triggers a refuel.

Seven years have passed since world war III, and only now dare you leave your shelter in order to investigate what has become of the surface world. You drive out in your specially-equipped vehicle, the Last V8, only to discover that the outside world is more hostile than you would have expected. Your task is now (as commended by a digitised voice at the beginning of each level) simply to get back to the base in as short time as possible.

The Last V8 is an over-head driving game where you must drive through narrow roads without crashing into anything, and with a strict deadline for your arrival at the base. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that you have only a narrow stripe of screen space to see where you're driving; two thirds of the screen is dedicated to instruments (speed readout, radiation level and mission objectives). The steering method is not the usual Sprint one; instead you simply pull the joystick in whichever direction you want to go, pulling it in the opposite direction in case you need to decelerate.

All versions except the C128 version have two levels. The first one takes place in an almost pastoral landscape where you must reach the scientific base, after which you must find your way back to your own base while avoiding radiation sources. A distance readout will help you find the correct route.

An old-fashioned football management game, in which you take over one of 64 clubs and try to lead them to glory. The choice is fairly arbitrary, as you can rename the team, you always start in the lowest of the four divisions, and the kits aren't real-life.

You start with only 11 players, and the maximum is 15, so you'll be keen to sign new players, and you get this opportunity after each match, when a player is offered, with his skill and form displayed. You can train your players to improve these skills, and sell players you don't rate highly.

Matches are played out via a succession of short animations, in which the home side wears red and the away side blue. At full time you are told how many injuries were incurred. The league season features 15 matches, one against each team, with the top two teams gaining promotion.

As Caesar you command up to 10 legions against the numerically superior barbarians in battles to conquer Gaul. You have just a few legions and one cavalry along with Caesar's legion, and with these the battles increase in difficulty and size. While the legions are usually stronger than the barbarians, and Caesar's legion is the strongest on the map, you must use the terrain and superior training of the Roman legions to defeat the hordes or you'll be overwhelmed. One of the first real time strategy games, the difficulty is very high in the late campaigns.

Anyone who still thinks electronic gaming is a mindless hobby should sit down to a few games of Lifespan. This multi-scenario action game is an analogy of a person's life experiences, from the cradle to the grave, with the ultimate objective of leading the longest, fullest life possible.

Each game begins with the birth spiral screen, wherein the player is treated to a pretty light sequence. While waiting for the fetus to "develop", the gamer can move the joystick in any direction to add musical tones to the birth chorus.

Gradually, the birth spiral fades away and the player becomes an infant in a playpen. The object of this screen is to isolate as many personality traits as possible (there are four altogether) to become as well-rounded a person as possible. To do this, garners move building blocks around the screen with their cursor, dropping the blocks near the corners of the playpen, thus keeping the free-bouncing personality traits from escaping. The more traits trapped, the sooner opportunities come knocking later and the longer the player's lifespan.

The third screen brings the gamer's character to the threshold of adulthood - the opportunity gates. The gates are actually a dark, forbidding corridor filled with tiny points of light.

Depending on the character traits trapped in early childhood, perfect and not-so-perfect opportunities whiz by on the screen. The best opportunities are those that look exactly like the player's character trait. Those with similar shapes but different colors (or colored alike but differently shaped) are decent opportunities, while those bearing no resemblance are the worst choices. The object of the screen is to locate the right opportunity, then enter it by passing through the center of its spiral.

Successfully entering an opportunity leads to the next scenario, situations and conversations. Unsuccessful tries have a negative effect on the gamer's health. This screen is an analogy to the social process, in which players must make contact with common interests (depicted as colored squares on the grid) in order to enter conversations with their peers. This must be done while avoiding creatures that rob the gamer of common interests. When enough common interests have been acquired and the player successfully joins a conversation, it's time for the most dangerous screen of all - the experience corridor.

Hurtling through the corridor at lightning speed, the player has to steer clear of the dark Worries, Fears and Doubts that threaten the health of the character. Large, bright lights are Hopes, which can reverse some of the debilitating effects of failure. If the player is strong enough to cope with life experiences, he or she is rewarded with an extra character dimension and a beautifully animated Insight before returning to the earlier screens to continue play.

The real payoff comes at the end in the form of a brilliant sound and light show, the electronic version of one's life flashing before his eyes. The better the player, the more spectacular the finale.

It's impossible to detail all the intricacies of the game in just one review. But it's a refreshing change to see a game that emphasizes aesthetics above scoring, without sacrificing a iota of playability in the process. John O'Neill, artist turned game designer, has succeeded in what he set out to do - to produce a great game that appeals to the psyche as well as the trigger finger.

The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.

You are Lode Runner's daughter, desperately trying to rescue your famous father from the clutches of the Bungeling Empire.  The Galactic Commando was captured while trying to recover stolen treasure, and now only you can save him.

You'd better be in great shape, because you'll be running, jumping and swimming through 46 challenging mazes on the way to his prison cell.  Your only weapons are your quick reflexes and even quicker wits, plus a magic mushroom or two.  Good luck, you'll need it!

And once you've rescued Lode Runner, the fun is just beginning! Lode Runner's Rescue also includes a powerful, icon-driven Game Editor that helps you desing, construct and save an unlimited number of mazes.  The easy-to-use Editor lets you decide where the elevators, trapdoors, keys, enemy guards, rivers and mushrooms should go,  so you can make the mazes just as hard as you want.  Then playtest each new screen before you save it permanently, just like the pros do.

The streets of Los Angeles are not safe. Lately, the kids are sick and tired of parents ordering them about and telling them what to do, so they decide to go out on the streets and threaten to club every policeman who gets in their way, making the streets not safe for the public, not even for little old ladies who decide to take a walk on a sunny day.

The bad news is: you're a police officer patrolling the streets, and you have two other police officers at your side. Your job is to shoot the little troublemakers that approach you. These troublemakers are harmless at a distance, but they are known to throw fire bombs at a few policemen. When you are killed by one of the troublemakers, one of the policemen replaces you as the one who gets to control the streets. If there is no policemen left, the game is over.

There are also turret guns located on top of buildings that fire, so you just can't stay on the footpath and hope not to get clobbered by the troublemakers. You just have to cross the road which is dangerous for a policeman in situations like this. When you come to the intersection, you'll come face-to-face with a gang, and you must shoot each gang member before they have a chance to leave you for dead. Once you've shoot all remaining gang members, a man appears holding a woman hostage. The object here is to shoot the man to free her. If you shoot the woman instead, you'll sacrifice 1000 points.

Your score increases when you walk, but score more points if you manage to shoot a troublemaker. You'll lose 100 points for killing a lady walking down the footpath.

M*A*S*H was one of the many attempts by various software companies to take a successful movie or television show and convert it into a playable game.

In this game, you play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce," a surgeon stationed at the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital #4077 during the Korean War (1950-1953). There are two main stages in the game, each of which you must pass to move to the next round. The first mission involves rescuing injured soldiers from the battlefield with your helicopter and returning them to home base without being shot down by enemy tanks. The second mission takes place in the operating room while you are required to carefully remove bullets and shrapnel from wounded soldiers... it is very similar to the classic "OPERATION" tweezers game by Milton Bradley.

Each set of missions are repeated four times. The first player to reach 999 points wins the game. There are four different variations of games, each selectable as either one player (against the computer) or two-player mode

M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.

You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.

Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.

After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.

After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.

Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. 

There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are: - M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it. - Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower. - Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players). - Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices. - Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production. - Sunspot activity - increases energy production. - Pest attack - eats all food on one plot. - Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.

M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. 

M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.

Trivia:

Despite the popularity of M.U.L.E. and the game's cult status, an official sequel or remake was never released. At least one version was in development, however. Developed by the German programming team Infernal Byte Systems exclusively for the Amiga, Deluxe M.U.L.E. was in the works in 1990. Aside from updated graphics and sound, the gameplay would remain mostly unchanged, with two exceptions: the terrain would be randomly generated, and players would be able to build weapons arrays to defend against space pirates. Deluxe M.U.L.E. was never released, because of both programming troubles and Electronic Arts revoking the license.

The platform puzzle which first introduced Luigi to the world has both single and multiplayer action with two differing game types, but with the same objective. Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they sit on, then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when a set number of coins is collected.

For the two player mode, the first to collect the set amount of coins wins.
 
This version is much better than the 5200 release.

Master of the Lamps casts you as an Eastern prince hoping to become King. There are two distinct gameplay sections, through which he must prove his worthiness. Firstly, you must ride a magic carpet, flying through a series of diamonds which twists and turns more as you move through the 41 levels. 

Alternating with this, you are in front of a row of pipes. Hit a gong 3 times to summon a genie, who will play a sequence of notes. Once the last one has been played, they fly towards you in order, and their colour equivalent on the row must be hit (the number of times they are played), before the flying note can hurt you. Complete this and a piece of lamp is granted.

This title was mentioned in the Tigervision 1983 Summer CES Press Kit. Previously a Rumor Mill item, this cartridge appeared on eBay in 2001 with a production label but it's still doubtful whether the game was ever officially released. Only one copy known to exist.

Pebbele Beach and St. Andrews are two of the courses on offer in this golf simulation, released in the early years of 16-bit technology. The three-click control system was used, whereby the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade.

Beginner and Expert difficulty options are given - the latter mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click even more crucial. You can also choose between regular and professional tees - in the latter option the distance on the holes is longer, and the computer doesn't choose the best club automatically. Because long drives aren't a crucial aspect of many of the holes, the Begginer/Expert setting is a bigger factor on your likely scoring. A uniquie feature for the day was the course designer, which was quite versatile with practice.

Trivia:

Was one of the first (if not the very first) golf games with the "tap to swing, tap for power, tap for hook/slice" control metaphor that has survived well into the 1990s.

Wee Willie is a window washer at an apartment who wants to keep his customers happy. Some of the customers welcome him and want their windows washed while others are worrisome about his wet work and would not want him washing their windows. There's only so much water for Willie to wield in his bucket, so he must only waste it on the welcoming window wash customers. It's also raining so Willie will have to remember who lives where.

Memory Manor is a memory matching game played from a side-view perspective. Players take control of Wee Willie who can move left and right, climb ladders and choose to wash a window he is in front of. The game relies on memory, after a brief glimpse of the people in the manor the windows fog up, hiding the occupants. The player must remember which windows contain happy customers and wash their windows. Willie has a limited water supply and so must not waste washing on anyone who doesn't want their windows washed. The game is over if Willie uses up all of his water.

Due to an engine malfunction, your spaceship crashes on the planet Targ. Unlike your trusty vessel, you survive the crash and now have to find a way to get away from this planet. But hey, while you're at it, you might as well try to get some money off your unplanned stay on Targ.

You're a mercenary, and it just so happens that the two races on the planet are at war. So why not use that to your advantage and do some favors for each race... against cash?

You play this game in a first-person perspective with vector graphics. There's a huge planet for you to explore, you can walk around on it or take airborne vehicles to reach elevated locations.

Mercenary: The Second City is an expansion disk for Mercenary, which features the same gameplay and controls.

Following the successes over Targ's Central City, the controller of the BENSON computer relaxes and enjoys himself. Soon however, he grows bored and starts looking around for new challenges on the still hazardous Planet Targ. Rumors about the Palyar Commander's brother-in-law living in the southern hemisphere suggest that this may be a good challenge. In this Second City, the battle between Palyars and Mechanoids still rages... and nothing is as it seems.

MIDI Maze holds a special place in gaming history as being one of the earliest (if not the first) first person shooters.  Originally released for the Atari ST in 1987, MIDI Maze allowed multiple players to fight each other in deathmatch combat years before Doom became part of the vocabulary of every gamer.

The secret to MIDI Maze was the MIDI interface (Musical Instrument Digital Interface).  This port found on all Atari ST computers, was normally used by musicians to hook up keyboards and synthesizers to the computer.  However some clever individuals figured out that it could also be used to network up to 16 computers together for multiplayer gaming (hence the name of the game).  However since the Atari XE doesn't have a MIDI port, the programmers graciously implemented several new networking options including the MIDIMate (a MIDI interface for the 8-bits), XM301 modem, SX212 modem, and even the Atari 850 interface.  This wide array of connection options ensured that all players would be able to enjoy the network gaming experience.

MIDI Maze allows players to chose from a surprisingly large number of gameplay options: Reload Time, Regen Time, Number of Lives, Bullet Speed, Turn Rate, Single or Team Play, and the Number of Drones and their intelligence (from Very Dumb to Nasty).  After choosing the game parameters, players are presented with some of the finest 3-D graphics to grace the XE.

The first thing you will undoubtedly notice is that the actual game area itself only takes up 1/4th of the screen.  This is due to the massive memory requirements of the game, and by using only a small portion of the screen the programmers were able to keep the frame rate incredibly smooth.  A compass to the left helps the player keep his bearings in the maze, while the smiley display above it shows the players current health (very similar to the Doom face).  To the right is the players 'kill' count display, which shows how many other players he has eliminated.  Above the screen there is a musical staff which displays each player's 'kill' count as a sort of graph.  Each player is displayed as a note, and the more 'kills' each player has, the higher they appear on the scale.  This is an obvious nod to the musical origins of the game, although ironically due to memory limitations there is no music in the game.  The bottom of the screen displays the chat log between players (this was years before real time chat became popular).  Pressing Tab at any time will bring up a map of the maze.

Unlike the grisly ultra violent first person shooters of today, MIDI Maze uses colorful 3-D smiley faces to represent each of the players.  Instead of shooting guns and lasers at each other, players hunt each other down using balls (deadly balls).  This decidedly nonviolent gameplay allows those under the age of 18 to enjoy the game as well as adults.  Even ultra conservative Nintendo didn't feel the need to censor the game when they ported the game to the NES as Faceball 2000..

MIDI Maze is an absolutely amazing game, and it pushes the XE hardware to its limits.  It's simply amazing to think that a networked multiplayer first person shooter was even possible on the Atari 8-bit hardware, much less one that supports real time chat.  It's a mystery as to why MIDI Maze was never released, but it was most likely due to Atari killing off its 8-bit line.  The decision to cancel the game must have been made very late, as preliminary box artwork had been completed.  It's a shame that a game as amazing as MIDI Maze never saw the light of day, because it is truly one of the lost gems of the Atari XE.

Molecule Man is trapped inside a radioactive maze of 256 screens, and it's your job to get him out. To do this you must collect 16 circuits which are located at extreme points of the levels. You must regularly consume radiation tablets to fend off certain poisoning, and your initial supply of 20 is totally inadequate.

Fortunately, there are coins dotted around the levels, as well as ant-radiation tablet vending machines at which you can buy them. Coins can also be used to buy more time, or to blow up obstacles which make some sections difficult or impossible to access. 

Viewed isometrically, the screen designs are intentionally surreal, each taking on an unlikely distorted real-world theme. If you find the initial level layouts too easy, too hard or too dull, you can design a new set with the bundled maze editor.

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

Your mission is to retrieve the Golden Baton, a priceless artifact worshipped by your race for eons. It maintains balance and keeps peace in the land, but now it has been stolen! Many have searched for it, none have returned. The player will face wolves and crabs, navigate a boat trip, and deal with a magical crystal. Most of the way, you use one object in some way to gain another.

Golden Baton uses the Scott Adams adventure engine, and thus has the same features - a basic 2-word parser, limited vocabulary (object names plus standard words such as EXAMINE, WEAR and DROP), and brief descriptions. Although primitive by later standards, these compare favourably to other IF of the time.
Number 10 in the Mysterious Adventures series of interactive fiction is inspired by the Agatha Christie book "And Then There were None". The player's aim is to find the gold statue, formed by Major Johnstone-Smythe from most of his assets shortly before his death. The Major also made 10 worthless copies in various colours, and hid them in and around his mansion. Only the 10 'little indian' figurines, assembled together, would reveal the location of the final golden one. These figurines are hidden behind and under ordinary household objects, and in various hiding places.

Around this time, Scott Adams' game engine was redone to allow complete sentences instead of the more primitive 2-word input that had been used previously. Brian Howarth gained the chance to use this in the Mysterious Adventures games, although early versions of the game may have still used the cruder parser.

Number 11 and final entry in the Mysterious Adventures series. You've spent a fun day at the local fair. Now you decide to head over to the waxworks for some fun. But you are tired. You lie down for a snooze...

Around this time, the game engine was redone to allow complete sentences instead of the more primitive 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously although early versions of the game may have still used the cruder parser.

You are a newspaper reporter, come to investigate the eccentric professor who lives all by himself out on the moors. When you get there, you find the place deserted though.

These games used the Scott Adams adventure engine, and thus also had the same limitations - a basic 2-word parser, limited vocabulary, and brief descriptions. Nevertheless, they were quite remarkable for their time, with little else on the market quite like them.

The Wizard of Akyrz is the eighth game in the in the Mysterious Adventures series. The player begins in the royal palace, where the king asks him to save his daughter from an evil wizard. If the player should succeed, his reward will be priceless.

Tetragorn the Necromancer has a fleet of evil beings at his disposal, from spiders to ogres and Hammerfists. You play Illuminar the wizard, aiming to use the forces of light and nature to triumph over dark.

There are three stages of play to this action game. Standing constantly in the centre of the screen, you must use your long-range Wisp weapon to create an army of them, while also fending off Ogres. Venom Spiders infect your trees - to prevent them from withering away, you must first kill the Spider, then hit the tree with your wisp. Eye-Pods (did Steve Jobs play this game?) can be hit to produce even more seeds.

Trees you produce in this stage are taken with you into the vaults, which are split into five increasingly-tough layers. Use your wisp to activate a tree, and guide it into the Spider larvae. It will then grow over it, and can be replaced in the storage area once it has completed its task. 

Larvae which does hatch turns into Sith Spiders, which kill trees and can kill Illuminar - destroy it with your wisp. Hammerfists are also primarily a hindrance - they destroy trees, and if they hit you, you must wrestle free before the can kill you. However, they will sometimes drop strength-giving rings, and random-effect Mysteries.

Once you reach Tetragorn's lair, you must destroy the headstones that trigger him. Once he has appeared, destroy him with your wisp, but above all you must avoid contact. Again, this stage takes place on 5 levels of increasing difficulty.

Players control Neptune who is exploring the depths of the ocean in search of his daughters held captive by the sea snake. The game is split into two sections. The first section has the player guiding Neptune through a series of underwater caverns while destroying jellyfish. The player also must shrink down weeds that get in their way. The weeds grow back to their original size after a few seconds, so the player must swim past them in a limited amount of time.

The second section has the player shooting crabs while avoiding falling debris. By shooting crabs, the player can pick them up and take it to the structure nearby where the player will see the daughters trapped in an aquarium guarded by the snake. To set her free, the player is required to drop the crab onto the snake's tongue. If the player repeats this enough times, the daughter is set free and the game restarts with a higher difficulty level.

There are two types of vehicles that Ed must face. There are harmless cars cruising the streets, and these cars can be run over without taking any damage to yourself. There are also tow trucks that can easily damage your Plymouth. If it takes enough damaged or it runs out of gas, then it is hauled to the garage while you are recovering in the hospital. You must hot-foot it all the way to the garage to pick up your car and fork out $100 for repairs. If you run out of money, the game is over. 

However, you are free to visit the bank to get some more. If you do this, then you need to avoid a series of bank robbers, who constantly fire at you and prevent you from reaching the teller on the opposite side. If you manage to reach the teller, then you are awarded $500 and the teller will close.

Your main objective is to visit two of the buildings, as indicated in your status bar. (Only two buildings are open at once.) To view a sight, you must find a parking space close by, get out of the car, and walk into the building. Each building contains a mini-game that must be completed before it can be deemed as 'seen'. Meanwhile, your car is metered, and if the parking meter expires, then it is towed away to the lot and you have to make your way to the lot to pick it up. The whole game must be completed in a day.

This is an side-scrolling beat-'em-up game consisting of a succession of fights, in which you (surprisingly) play a ninja whose job is to go through the playfield and kill everyone in his path. You are also equipped with a dagger and a shuriken which you can hurl at your enemies.

You must also collect "idols" which are left lying around), which will reinvigorate you, as well as grant you further points. Once you collect all of the idols, you will have won the game.

It is May 8, 1941 and you are Captain of the mighty German battleship Bismarck the single most powerful ship in the Atlantic. Hitler has given you the nearly impossible task of fighting through the British Home Fleet and sinking enough convoys to force Britain to surrender. Your level of victory will be determined by how many merchant ships and battleships you can sink. Your decisions will determine the fate of the Bismarck.

The time is the late 20th century. You and a neighboring country have developed a nuclear capability. Your neighbor's sole objective is to utterly annihilate you. As the tension mounts while you are conducting espionage, building bombers,missiles,submarines and anti ballistic missiles either you or your neighbor launch a pre-emptive first strike.The nuclear destruction continues until either all weapons are expended or a truce is negotiated. Victory is determined by population remaining and world political opinion which is usually against the side that started the war. If both sides lose enough people neither will win.

As an Irish prospector named Timothy O'Riley, dig an unending series of mines searching for coal, gold, diamonds, rubies, and oil. But watch out for the evil creatures you've disturbed and the rising underground river - don't let either one touch you or you will die! And beware - the creatures move much faster while the moon is up. The river is unstoppable, but you can kill or block the creatures with a limited supply of dynamite.

O'Riley's Mine is essentially a high-speed variant of Mr. Do! and Boulder Dash - you must race around collecting everything before returning to the top of the mine shaft while the creatures chase you and the water rises relentlessly.

Ollie has made the mistake of entering a factory which turns out to be ran by evil robots. It is split into 24 tough screens to complete in order, none of which are designed to be easy for a human to navigate.

Ollie's Follies is a simple 2D sci-fi platformer displaying the kind of horizontally layered environments Frank Cohen became well known for. Each level's objective is disarmingly simple - just get from one end of the screen to the other. These contain teleports, guard robots to avoid, and an array of complex ledges to navigate. Later screens add moving platforms, laser bolts and deflectors, and require a key be collected to open the door. Be careful not to fall too far, as this costs you one of your five lives, as does contact with a robot.

Control a droid on the planet Andromadous trying to herd Ramboids (alien sheep) into a teleporter. First the droid has to travel through a chamber filled with constantly moving Ramboids. Then the Ramboids must be herded towards the teleport receptor in a particular order. As well as the droid's standard movement mode, it can also tunnel or dig through the caverns. In later levels, the cavern designs become more complex and moving blocks create further problems.

Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. 

At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.

Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.

The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points.

Peanut Butter Panic is a game for two players where your goal is to create peanut butter sandwiches! To do this, you need to jump up and grab stars from the top of the screen which can be used to power the sandwich machine. Some stars are too high to reach by just jumping; on either side of the screen is a spring board which can be used to launch your partner higher. After making sandwiches, you can then eat them to replenish your energy supply. Eating sandwiches also makes your character heavier which allows you to launch your partner even higher when jumping on the spring board. On some levels you need to watch out for Snarfs which will eat your sandwiches! The game ends when you run out of energy.

The player is guarding four full picnic tables while armed only with a fly-swatter and an occasional can of bug spray. Ants soon crawl on-screen and, in character, attempt to carry the food away. Spiders that lay delaying webs show up on round two, and can sting player, paralyzing him, if he isn't careful. A flying wasp, which also stings, appears at random. Points are awarded for swatting any of these marauders. Each round lasts a minute and a half and, at the end of each round, bonus points are awarded for any remaining food. As soon as all food is pushed off of the screen, or a round ends with no food still on any of the tables, the game ends.

Pitstop is an action racing game featuring six different race tracks. Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.

Wow! Running away to the circus. That's what the instructions say this game is about. Baby stuff! Plattermania may put you off at first. But, the saving grace of this cartridge is that it isn't really about running away to join the circus. Rather, it's a horizontal action game of skill that gets so fast so soon, it can provide a tasty challenge.

When you start it up, Plattermania is instantly pleasing to the eye. Your player, a yellow clown who we'll call Bozo, waits behind a long table. On the table are a row of 12 evenly spaced upright sticks or stands. When you hit the red button on your paddle controller, Bozo reaches up and puts a spinning platter on the stand touching his hat. After a while, the platter starts to wobble-a pretty good 3-D effect-then it wobbles more and finally it falls. You can spin the platter to keep it from falling by positioning Bozo behind it and hitting the red button. Hit the button twice and the platter will fly off the stick and crash. (The exception is that when it's really wobbling badly, you have to give it two or even three spins.)

Keeping the platters spinning for 8 seconds is all there is to it. There are no different screens. This clown act is the entire circus!

Sounds simple? It is in the beginning. In the first level, all you have to do is put your platters up. They take about eight seconds to wobble and 25 seconds to fall. But, by round eight, things are really cooking. To keep the platters spinning, you've got to whip Bozo's butt up and down that line. I found this doable after 20 minutes of getting the hand of it. But, by the last round, the platters start to wobble in one second and fall in five. By the time I could get to the end of the row, the first platter had nearly smashed!

The problem is that Plattermania can get old on you, since it only gets faster, never different. How much time do you want to spend spinning platters?

At higher levels, don't even look of the plotters. Just keep whipping down the row hitting the trigger button as you pass each stick.

Innovative Design has made quite a reputation for itself among Apple II owning gamers with its string of successful disks for that system. Now the company has enlarged its electronic pool hall to provide sufficient room for Atari computerists. Pool 400 packs much of the detail of IDSI's Pool 1.5 into an easy-to-use ROM cartridge for the Atari microcomputers.

The most exciting feature of this generally well-executed game is the "instant replay". When you send the cue ball into the side pocket with this game, you get a chance to try the whole shot over again. Too bad real-life pool sharks aren't quite that amiable about such things.

Pool 400 will be especially welcomed by those who don't have lightning reflexes. Good strategy and a sharp eye for geometry count far more heavily.

If you are sent to the swamp a second time, you can climb out right away but look out for Porky.

Place a brick=100 points

Getting out of the swamp screen=100 points

Each pole vault jump=lose 25 points

Falling into swamp=lose 100 points

Caught by Porky=lose a random number of points

The Shower
-------------------
Push the random object that appears at center, top into the pit at the bottom without getting caught by Ms. Balbricker or falling in the pit the climb out the top back to the county line. Every time you get through the shower, you stop or slow a lane on the highway.

You get 100 points for pushing an object into the pit.

You lose 200 points if you fall in the pit or are caught by Ms. Balbricker.

Every ten seconds you are in the shower, you lose ten points so don't dawdle.

An arcade style game with a loose basis on the arcade hit Defender, Protector II is a side-scrolling shooter. Like Defender, there are lots of different aliens to contend with, and some ground based enemies as well. There are no smart bombs, however. You have to rescue humans as well (twice) from both an alien ship, and later a city that will be overrun with lava from a volcano that erupts during the game; all the while protecting them from aliens. You then have to drop them one at a time (unlike Defender, you can only carry one human at a time) into a teleporter tube to get them off the planet entirely. The game is quite difficult, with some very precise flying required at times (probably even more difficult than Defender or Stargate). It also has more of a "plot" than the arcade games it is based on, with several sub-missions of rescue depending on what stage you are at (it should be noted that there is no breaks between "stages" - the whole game play is continuous).

In this game, you guide a marker which must draw rectangles and other weird objects in order to claim your territory, and you can either draw these rectangles fast or slow. Drawing the rectangles using the "slow" method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level.

In Serpentine you control a multi-segmented snake in a maze; your goal is to survive and earn as many points as possible. At the beginning of each level, three enemy snakes will also enter the maze. To complete the level, you need to eat all of the enemy snakes. If an enemy snake has more segments than your snake, you can only eat segments that form the tail of the snake; a collision with the head is lethal! Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow. Both your snake and enemy snakes will leave eggs behind occasionally; left alone, these will hatch (your eggs earn you an extra life, enemy eggs will hatch another snake). Eggs can also be eaten to remove them from the playfield, so it's usually a good idea to eat enemy eggs before a new snake hatches! 
The maze changes for each level, and the enemy snakes progressively become larger and tougher to catch.

The Sesame Street Muppets invite a child player for a spin on the Letter-Go-Round!. By catching and matching letters on a spinning ferris wheel, children practice recognizing and matching letters, simple spelling and word formation.

There are several types of game:

- Upper case matching; 

- Lower case matching; 

- Mixed case matching; 

- One little word; 

- What's missing?; 

- Spell the secret word. 

At the start of each game, one of Muppet pets brings out a letter to match or word to spell and drops it on the seesaw. A letter appears on each ferris wheel bucket and as the Letter-Go-Round spins, child player should find the right letter to match or complete a word. Child may choose and try any letter, because there is no time limit to play. When a match is made or a word is completed, Muppet pets will dance and cheer a child player to the next round of play.

The game is recommended for 1 player aged 3 to 4.

Slime is a victim of an alarming trend sacrificing game play in order to achieve originality. It can be honestly said that Slime is an original game. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean that Slime is a good game. It isn't. It doesn't live up to the standards of a good home video game, let alone a computer game. The primary object of Slime is to build a barrier of wedgeshaped (triangular) blocks to block the way of slime which is falling from the sky. And, of course, the slime is being dropped by killer aliens. The secondary objective is to deflect the slime into one of two giant vacuum tubes that are located at the edges of the screen. This gives you bonus points and also keeps the ocean from rising which is good.

You are given a large ship which fires the triangular blocks that deflect the slime. The blocks can be destroyed by lightning storms, rampaging UFOs and fireballs. The maximum number of wedges available to the player is 20. If all 20 blocks are on the screen, you must position your target exactly on top of a block you want to eliminate - then press the red button and the wedge will disappear. This maneuver will give you an extra wedge which you can place anywhere above the ocean level. There are also UFOs that carry giant plugs with which they try to plug up your vacuum tubes. If they succeed, you have to wait for a chopper to come and take the plug out.

The game has some nice features like very sharp graphics and, more importantly, total control over game variations. What this means is that you get to select the number of points you must earn before you are awarded a bonus ship, how high the ocean level is to begin with and the number of ships you want to use.

Regrettably, the game's deficiencies outweigh the good points by far. The sound effects are probably the worst ever heard on any computer game. The controls are what the company (Synapse) refers to as "sensitive" but, in any other dictionary, they would be defined as unwieldy and terribly jumpy. The ship from which you fire moves absolutely randomly, thus making you a pawn to the whims of fortune, regardless of how well you play. And, last but not least, the fireballs destroy everything in their path. Thus all that wonderful control comes to nothing.

Instead of blocking the slime as it falls from the sky, position your target right below the dropping slime. As soon as the slime touches the mark, fire a block.

Every feature you could possibly want in a video soccer game has been packed into this cartridge: two teams of 11 players each (they look like little wooden pegs, but so what) trotting up and down the full-length field that scrolls laterally in three sections, kicking and passing a black and white checkered ball, scoring goals past the hapless goalie... it's all here.

So are the countless play options that allow you and as many as three other players to divide into teams with or without the computer helping out one or both teams. There is even a hopeless option where you attempt to challenge the computer alone. Include the possibilities of other variables such as different time limits and difficulty levels and you will soon decide the only thing left out of this game is a British announcer.

But despite the countless alternatives, there are only two of any competitive consequence. First you can watch the computer play itself to a draw, or you can remove the computer from all competition and stick to human opponents. Invite the computer to play against you (he is totally merciless) or be on your team (he is an insufferable showoff) and you immediately become the weakest player on the field. Your team is actually better off without you.

Another problem with the game becomes apparent when you want to gain control of a player. Pushing the fire button will activate the member of your team closest to the ball and he will stop moving and proudly display the number of your joystick port. This means that just as you need the player most he stands still, if only for a fraction of a second. Or say the player you really need to activate is the goalie. If he is not the nearest to the ball, forget it. By the time he has earned that distinction the opponent has probably scored.

Your best chance of enjoying the game is to find some friends of equal talent and go for it. You can play until your thumbs turn stiff and your wrists freeze up but you'll never be able to compete in the computer's league.

Never pass the ball across the front of your own goal. It is an open invitation for the other side to score.

Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.

You have the power, with your electric cobra under your copmlete control, you must reconnect the power grid.  The toasters of the world depend on you.  Try to align each of the insulated electrodes with the power base.  But watch for those darn Spark Bugs.  The Spark Bugs will move the electrodes while they are aligned.  But when a Spark Bug moves an electrode below you, you must use the elevators to go up or down to reposition it.  Of course, the electric cobra can move each electrode into position by moving in front of it, then moving to align it with the base.  However, if an electrode is moved you cannot align any electrodes above it.  To get zapping with your Spark Bugs insert your Romox ECPC cartridge into your Atari home computer and turn on the juice.  You may press the option key to choose the two player mode.  You can also select one of the five levels of difficulty available.  During the title display, you may turn off the music by pressing the start key.  To begin the attack, press the joystick fire button.  Now prepare yourself, here they come.

As you advance from level to level, you will encounter four different Spark Bugs.  You will be plagued by the battery beetles, then with the duragizer bug, and the AC hornet to follow.  In level one, only the battery beetle will batter your electrodes.  But in level two, two beetles banter about.  To eliminate a beetle, simply press the fire button and zap. However, the duragizer bugs and the AC hornet cannot be killed.  To avoid them as they appear in levels three, four and five, you must jump out of the way by pressing the fire button and moving the joystick lever up.

When you have all the electrodes in alignment, the zap gap will become activated, and spell doom for the mother bug.  However, the next level will not be so easy.  Once beyond the first five levels, you speed, and that of the Spark Bugs will increase with each new level.  To pause the game at any time, simply press the space bar.

In the main, horizontally scrolling section, Santa rides his sleigh and tries to collect presents being dropped by his helpers while avoiding clouds and mountains. The presents from the Red Devil should be avoided. If enough are collected, Santa can land on a house to deliver the presents personally. (Otherwise he can only drop them down the chimneys while flying.)

Going down the chimney means having to dodge flames from below and snowballs from above. Once inside the house, Santa can leave the presents under the Christmas tree, get the key to the door and leave. He fails if he wakes any of the sleepwalking children who are running from room to room.

The only thing that's predictable about Innovative Design Systems, the publisher of this 16K cartridge for the Atari computer systems, is its unpredictability. Few companies have compiled such a consistent record of coming up with the unusual title, the game that's at least several strides off the beaten track. IDSI games don't always have nail-biting play-action, but they seldom fail to present a new and novel arcading experience.

Speedway Blast preserved IDSI's reputation intact. The player wields a joystick to steer a racing car through a macro-maze composed of the streets of a small city. Driving the vehicle is a snap, and it shouldn't take most arcaders too long to learn how to execute hairpin turns even at top speeds.

It's a good thing the racer is highly maneuverable, since it has to be just about everywhere at once to battle the pothole monsters that are rapidly chewing up the asphalt. A secondary display helps the gamer find the quarry, which "hatch" out of eggs that can be found at most intersections when the game begins. The player scoops up as many of these eggs as possible - and then uses a hood-mounted gun to fill in the holes and dispatch the monsters which dug them. When all the streets are free of both monsters and potholes, the game kicks up to the next difficulty level and resumes.

The graphics in Speedway Blast are about the best ever seen on an IDSI game. Though the monsters are little more than a few lines without a great deal of charm or character, the car and the town it patrols are exceptionally well-depicted. Wheeling the little auto up and down streets at breakneck speeds is actually fun in and of itself, and the addition of the shoot-'em-up element completes the picture in outstanding fashion.

The Zylons have returned to attack the Celos IV star system. In this 3D shoot-'em-up, the player takes control of the Liberty Star and must warp to threatened planets to battle the Zylon Fly Fighters and Destroyers. The Zylon Squadrons can also be attacked while in transit, and friendly Space Stations allow refueling. To achieve victory, the Zylon Attack Bases on their own planets must be destroyed. The game ends if the Liberty Star runs out of fuel, or if all cities are destroyed by Zylons.

Trivia:

The Atari 8-bit version of this game started out as an Atari 5200 prototype game of The Last Starfighter that was graphically altered.

You're the commander of a World War II submarine on patrol in the Mediterranean and there are enemy convoys at all points of the compass. Your job is to sink as much enemy shipping as possible while keeping your sub intact. This is no fast-paced shoot-em-up. You're really in a sub with all of its problems and limitations-batteries that need recharging, an air supply that needs to be replenished by surfacing, and the sub's very slow speed when you're submerged.

There are three different screen displays-all flanked by a cluster of instruments and gauges that tell you depth, remaining air supply, torpedoes and condition of various parts of the sub. The three displays show a map that pinpoints your own location and where the enemy convoys are, sonar and hydrophone displays, and a periscope view which works only when you're at 45 feet of depth or less.

You're surrounded by danger. If the destroyers' depth charges don't damage you, it's possible to scrape or get stuck on the bottom, damaging your propellers and engines; you can run out of air or battery charge; or your hull can crack from diving too deep.

The joystick controls diving and surfacing as well as compass heading. The button fires torpedoes, but you can't shoot more than two at any one time, since it takes time to reload the torpedo tubes. Also, you can't fire unless your depth is just right (about 35 feet or higher). The sub responds to controls with agonizing slowness.

Yet the rewards are enormous. Whenever you hit an enemy ship, you want to jump up and cheer. There are plenty of misses, too, and when you're within torpedo range, you're usually getting smeared by a barrage of depth charges.

This is a long game-it can easily take a half-hour or more to either sink all the enemy ships or get yourself sunk. Time is eaten up by repairs and recharging the batteries on the surface. You have to watch your sonar bottom display very carefully-along with a dozen or so other displays and gauges. The realism level of this game is incredible, and there are no magic escape hatches. The graphics are super, and the game has a lot of staying (and frustration) power. Playing strategy? There isn't one; just have patience while those repairs are being made.

Super Zaxxon is a three-quarter perspective, space shooter style game. You must first go over a base on an asteroid. Things located on this base include gun implacements, fuel tanks, radar stations, missiles, and fighters. After you successfully navigate this base, you will go through a tunnel to tangle with enemy fighters, mine layers, and mines. You then will have to navigate through a series of barriers on another asteroid in order to take on the Super Zaxxon's, the enemy robot dragons.

The game is very similar in appearance to Zaxxon. The differences are:
Your fighter moves much faster. This makes going after ground targets a big challenge.

The graphics are different. Although this is more of a viewing difference, it can still change ones perspective after they have gotten used to the Zaxxon graphics.

There is no more outer space battle. Instead, you must go through a narrow tunnel to get to area 3.

Instead of 20 fighters, you now have to tangle with 25 fighters in area 2.

A new enemy, the Mine Layer, is introduced. As the name implies, this ship lays mines in your path. You can destroy the mines but it takes a few hits.

Instead of encountering one Zaxxon robot, you now have to deal with three Super Zaxxon, dragon looking robots.

The placement of things (fuel tanks, gun implacements, etc.) in areas 1 and 3 is different then in Zaxxon.

There are now indestructible, elevated guns in area 1. These guns sit on the right side and they are 2.5 units in altitude.

Poor Topper, the little lovable turtle, who tries to liven up his universe by trying to paint his galactic tiles.  But, the mysterious dynamite, and the renegade rabbit, will stun him if they can.  It's up to you.  Can you help Topper while keeping hime from getting caught by the renegaged rabbits?  Can you save him from the mysterious dynamite before his tile is demolished?  Topper needs you.

To begin your adventure into Topper's enhanced reality, insert your ROMOX ECPC cartridge into your Atari home computer and turn on the power.  Select to play alone or with your friend and choose Topper's difficulty from A thru D.  Then simply press your joystick fire button or press the start key.  Get ready, here comes Topper.  Now it's up to you.  You must help Topper get from tile to tile to paint his home, but watch out, the tiles don't want to be painted and fly off with Topper on it, so you are safe.  But not safe from the mysterious dynamite or the rabits.  As you advance from group to group, the difficulty will change and Topper will have a real hard time trying to finish.  So keep your hands steady and your wits about you.

The levels of difficulty will change automatically from A through D, unless otherwise selected at the beginning of the game, every four tile groups.  Time is your worst enemy.  In each level, a fixed time limit makes Topper have to hurry more and more.  In level A, only the tiles try to escape from your Topper.  This is the easiest level.  In level B, your tiles continue to jump in and out.  But now you have to face the mysterious dynamite stick, which looks for you everywhere.  It's mission in life is to break your tiles with you on them.  In level C, the rabbits are here.  The renegade rabbits have landed and are out to get you.  But in this level, you only have to worry about one rabbit.  In level D, a whole bunch are out to stop you.  The tiles jump off at any moment.  The dynamite will try to blow the tile you are on, and the renegade rabbits try to catch your Topper.  If you can save him, and complete the tile group before the time runs out, you get to do it again, and again, and again....

Port of the popular Amiga game Nebulus, Tower Toppler is a fast paced puzzle/action platformer in which you play a frog-like creature who must destroy several evil towers that are polluting your planet's pristine oceans.  Atari decided to rename the game to Tower Toppler for some reason when they ported it to the 7800 and XE.  Oddly enough Nintendo also decided to rename the game to Castelian when they ported the game to the NES.  I guess no one liked the original name (maybe it was a bit too nebulous?).

So how exactly does a frog-like creature destroy an evil tower?  By climbing to the top of course!  Of course getting to the top of each tower isn't easy, as hordes of evil creatures and dastardly puzzles await our froggy hero as he ascends.  Thankfully most enemies can be shot and removed from your path, but just shooting enemies won't help you achieve your goal, you must also solve the puzzles of each tower to succeed.

Each tower contains a series of lifts, holes, platforms, doors, and disappearing tiles to impede your progress.  Successfully navigating these hazards requires a bit of memorization, and a whole lot of guesswork.  Also making things a bit difficult is the fact that the tower actually rotates as you climb, this means you have little or no warning of what is coming up.  Although your little frog creature can jump, his stubby little legs won't take him far so he can't jump across gaps.  If you get hit by an enemy you will be knocked down a level, if you fall all the way down into the water you will lose a life.  Running out of time will also result in losing a life.

Between each tower you will be treated to a short little bonus round.  In these bonus rounds you pilot a little submarine and must blast fish with bubbles.  After encasing each fish in a bubble you must touch it to gain the bonus points.  These bonus rounds also help explain how you travel from tower to tower, as they end when you arrive at the next tower.

The XE version of Tower Toppler uses a high resolution graphics mode called Mode 8.  Mode 8 is extremely high resolution, but achieves this by sacrificing color.  That's right, monochrome!  However Tower Toppler is able to achieve some color through the use of artifacting.  Artifacting is a special programming technique that allows a programmer to produce extra colors beyond what the pallet would normally allow, by taking advantage of a flaw in the Atari 8-bit graphics chip (it's not a bug, it's a feature!).  However these colors are dependent on the hardware of system and cannot be controlled by the programmer.  So what does this all mean?  Well on an Atari 800XL the color of tower will be green, while the water is brown, and blue.  However on the Atari XEGS the colors are a nasty shade of green and purple.  For this reason it is best to play Tower Toppler on an 800XL with a good old TV.  Unfortunately for all you monitor users, all you'll see are some grainy black & white visuals.  Emulator users will also have trouble getting correct colors as these screen shots demonstrate.

So how come Tower Toppler was never released?  According to the programmer (who also did the Atari 7800 version), Atari decided to stop supporting the Atari 8-bit game market and pulled the plug on the project.  Atari may also have been concerned the Tower Toppler's odd artifacted color scheme looked quite nasty on the XEGS, which was Atari's main 8-bit game machine at the time.  Although it has long been assumed that Tower Toppler was destined for release in the UK, the game was actually developed on an NTSC machine and has issues when played on PAL systems (such as no colors and it crashes during the bonus round).  No matter what the reason for its cancellation, Tower Toppler is a wonderful game and an excellent edition to the 8-bit library.

Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels. Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels. You are not alone, however. A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you. Therefore, the ultimate objective of Turmoil? is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by. Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day! As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side. Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long. If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.

The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them. Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel. This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway. In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it. If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points. If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way. When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships. If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship. In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time. You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level. This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.

Do you like word games?  Then you'll love Up For Grabs.  Because it's fast paced, exciting, and educational all at the same time.

You've got to think fast.  Because you have to grab the letters you want off the rotating cube before anyone else does.  And then place them in your playing area and build words, as quick as you can!

But not so fast that you don't plan ahead.  Because those gray squares are double letter scores.  And letters that don't make words count against you.

Up to 4 people can play.  Or y ou can play alone, against the computer.  So develop your skill and quick wits.  And have a great time playing Up For Grabs.
