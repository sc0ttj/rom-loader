The Pagemaster was released in conjunction with the Macaulay Culkin part live-action part cartoon feature film released in 1994. You can guide your character through a selection of levels based around themed books, ranging from Horror to Adventure and Fantasy worlds. You can use magic and stomp enemies to death by jumping on their heads. Enemies include bats, flying books, giant hands, ghosts, pirates and many more. The PC version of the game is completely different, being an interactive adventure game, and bearing a different plot rather than borrowing the movie's plot.
