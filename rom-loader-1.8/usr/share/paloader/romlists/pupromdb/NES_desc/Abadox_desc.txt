Overview - 
Parasitis, a planet-swallowing monster, has swallowed a hospital ship with the princess of Abadox aboard. You are Lieutenant Nazal. Your job is to fly inside Parasitis, rescue Princess Maria, and destroy parasitis from the inside.

Abadox is a side scrolling shooter where you're inside a giant alien. The game plays a lot like Life Force or Gradius in that it is a shooter with upgradeable weapons and speed. In Abadox, however, you are a spaceman rather than a man in a spaceship.

The graphics in this game had a surprising amount of detail for an 8-bit system. The alien's organs and veins look pretty real. Sometimes they even move. There seems to be a repeat of the same background music for a good many of the levels. The sound effects were good, though.

Directions - 
Fly Lt. Nazal through the alien to save Princess Maria. Be sure to get at least one speed power-up, or you won't be fast enough to move out of the way of enemies and their fire. Some people prefer two, but don't get three. You will be too fast and hard to control. Grabbing power-ups is essential, because they add to your firepower. With three-way and five-way shots, laser beams, and circle beams, there are a lot of options for weapons. They also have power-ups that will protect you from enemies. It will start circling you as soon as you get it, and give you an extra hitpoint. Other than that, you only have one hitpoint.
