You are a driver. Race down the track at supersonic speed and earn money to pimp your ride. Use nitros to burst past opponents with huge amounts of speed. Win the race. Beat out the world's best.

Directions:

Race your racecar among 19 others and win. 

Gameplay:

In this sequel, the game becomes more realistic, with a damage bar on the left side of the screen, slower cars, and the possibility to upgrade your machine. The cars become more difficult to handle and the opponents are faster and tougher than in the previous game. The new addition of weather also plays a role, forcing the player to change from dry to wet tires.

The game takes place in 16 countries including 64 cities, starting with Australasia (Australia and New Zealand). After each country is beaten, the player is given a password, which can be later used to pick the game back up from that position.

The actual gameplay is quite simple, there is a map showing which directions the upcoming turns will be, and the player is given 6 "nitro boosts" at the start, which dramatically increase the cars speed for a short period of time. On certain courses there are pickups along the road ranging from a "$" which is $1,000 cash, a "N" which is an extra "nitro boost", and a "S" which is an automatic nitro administered right when picked up and returns each lap. The other pickups can only be collected once per race.

The player has the option of either an automatic or manual gearshift, and can configure the controls as they please at the opening menu of the game.

Hints:

- Using Nitro - 
Only use nitros when the race begins, and on straight stretches. Because if you use the Nitros at the beginning, you'll be able to go through a lot of other cars, and go up the ranks faster. Be careful, because if you hit someone on the way through, it goes on your car as damage, and your car's top speed goes down. And on straight stretches, use them. Because if you use Nitros on curves, you'll risk hitting objects and losing valuable time.

- Your car isn't like an anti virus program with updates -
If you buy a part for a car, make sure you get the best one right away. This minimizes cost but it'll be harder because you're still working with the factory stock parts going up into the more experienced drivers. But remember, if you've got an upgrade, never ever select the stock item, because this will give your upgrade away, and you won't get any money back. 

- Get a Dodge Viper -
At the start screen scroll down to the options and enter. Once there scroll to cheats. At the cheats menu simply enter (5anniversary). No parenthesis are included. This game was themed with the 5th anniversary of the Dodge Viper creation in 1989. Its no better then any other car in the game it just looks different.
