Minter is revered for his irreverence and this game is a true testament to why this is so. AMC plays a bit like the Parker Bros "The Empire Strikes Back" game, though your ship is now attempting to stop the slowly advancing giant mutant camels instead. Super smooth and still loads of fun to play. Rock on, Llamasoft
