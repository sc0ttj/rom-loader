Uridium is the obvious influence on this shooter, viewed from above and scrolling both left and right. As a member of the Mirax Force attack team, you and your Star Quest spaceship are crucial to your planet's survival. Fly Star Quest over an enemy mothership, destroying as many bays and circuits as possible, and ultimately the Main Reactor itself. You will be chased by enemy fighter ships, and have to avoid protective gun bays. The background colour changes every time you lose a life, and the game includes sampled speech (performed by the programmer).
