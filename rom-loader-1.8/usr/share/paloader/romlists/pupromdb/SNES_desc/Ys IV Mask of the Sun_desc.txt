If you've played Ys 1 or Ys 2 (probably more 2), you'll be right at home! It plays pretty similarly to those games, you know.. Run into an enemy head-on and die, that kind of thing. It's basically the same game, except the graphics are just a tiny bit nicer looking. Which is to be expected, you know, for an early SNES title in part of an ongoing NES series. Just look at DQ5 and FF4, you know? Thankfully the game still rocks ass, so you'll have a good time with it.

4 Feb 07 - Gideon means business with this 2.0 release. A completely rewritten script, new and improved font, and it now works on copiers. It's complete, it's polished, and it works. What more can you ask for? If you haven't given this a try yet, what are you waiting for?
