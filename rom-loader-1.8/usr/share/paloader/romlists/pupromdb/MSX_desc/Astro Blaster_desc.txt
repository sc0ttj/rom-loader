Alpha Blaster is a vertical shooter. You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen which can scroll from left to right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders and to fire your own missiles to fight back!

Prepare to defend the earth from alien forces in direct combat. Blast your way through two waves of aliens and then negotiate the asteroid belt to dock with the mother ship.

Points: 100 for aliens, 200 for descending aliens, 10 for fuel and a mystery bonus for docking with the mother ship.
