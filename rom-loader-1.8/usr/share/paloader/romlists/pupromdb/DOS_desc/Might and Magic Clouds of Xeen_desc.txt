Fourth installment of New World Computing's best-selling RPG-Series Might and Magic. This time, you control a party of 6 heroes to save the world from the claws of evil Lord Xeen.

The game uses nearly the same interface and graphics as Might and Magic III - Isles of Terra. Only small enhancements were made, e.g. that you don't encounter any NPC randomly but have to select him via mouse click.

All over the gaming world, there are pyramids which work as teleporters as soon as part five of the series, Darkside of Xeen is installed. Might and Magic 4 and 5 together let you create the "World of Xeen" which includes multiple cross-over quests in both parts of the game.
