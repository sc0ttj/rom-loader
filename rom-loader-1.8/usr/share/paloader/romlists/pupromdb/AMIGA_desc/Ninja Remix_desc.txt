The Last Ninja is an action-adventure computer game that was developed and published by System 3 in 1987 for the Commodore 64. As the first in the Last Ninja series, it set the standard for the unique look and feel for its sequels: Last Ninja 2 (1988), Last Ninja Remix (1990, a remake of the first game on Amiga and remake of the second game on Commodore 64 ) and Last Ninja 3 (1991).
Other format conversions were later released for the Apple IIGS, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron and Acorn Archimedes in 1989. Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions were planned, and in progress, but never appeared.
The game was one of the most successful games released on the Commodore 64, winning many awards and positive reviews from video game journalism. It was re-released on Wii Virtual Console in Europe in April 2008 as the fifth Virtual Console C64 title, and in North America in February 2009 as one of the first three C64 titles. Its sequel, Last Ninja 2, was also released for the Virtual Console.
