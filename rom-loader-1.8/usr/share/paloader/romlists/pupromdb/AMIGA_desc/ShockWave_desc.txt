The year is 2167 ad. You command a prison outpost which also acts as a
terminal for transporting dangerous and subversive criminals to a maximum
security prison colony, the moon. Over the past 2 years you have been
personally responsible or sending over 1000 people into exile.
Time passed and everyone was happy with this arrangement, except the
colonials, as time went by they inreased in strenght and rsolve, building
small space craft in order to wreak their revenge. soon they were able to
attack and overcome four space stations orbiting the earth, from where they
planned their final attack on earth itself.
The authorities, in their ultimate wisdom,decided the colonials would
definitely attack one of the main cities, and thus concentrated their
defence around them, inevitably the colonials thought you would make an
ideal first target.
All you have to do is survive for ten attack waves before reinforcements
arrive.
