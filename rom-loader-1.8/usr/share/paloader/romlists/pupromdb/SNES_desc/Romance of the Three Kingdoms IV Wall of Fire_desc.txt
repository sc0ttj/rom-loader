Once again, you must try to unify the various provinces of China, and become Emperor. Romance of the Three Kingdoms 4 continues to improve upon this already great series of strategy games.

Your generals now have special abilities as well as scores in Intelligence, Charm, etc. so you can get specialists for different military and civic tasks. Also there is a greater variety of options, both in military and civic commands. City improvements can boost your economy, and new spells can be taught to your leaders to quickly turn the tide of battles.

Tips:

Form Anti-Dong Zhuo Coalition
Select the first scenario (Dong Zhuo Triumphs in Luo Yang), then select Cao Cao as your leader. On your very first turn, move some generals and troops to Xu Chang. A few months later, Cao Cao will call a meeting, asking all the other leaders to form an alliance against Dong Zhuo. If Yuan Shao joins, he will become leader; otherwise, Cao Cao will become leader.  This makes defeating Dong Zhuo a bit easier, depending on who joins you (such as Yuan Shao or Ma Teng).

Unlimited Soldiers
Use the War command and select a general to go into battle.  Assign the maximum number of men to his unit.  When they asked for confirmation for going to war select the 'No'option.  Remove the general from the list of commanders and reassign him to the post.  Return to the troop assignment screen.
