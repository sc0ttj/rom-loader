Cyber Spin uses a top-down perspective and was designed in the same technique as classic arcade racing games. There are ten different tracks in the United States, Peru, Spain, Kenya, and England.[5] Players of the game become a part of a science-fiction version of the 2016 Formula One season. The goal is to win every race and to eventually win the championship. All of the automobiles are turbocharged with advanced futuristic technology. The player must qualify to make it into the main event. Unlike Circuit USA, the player does not automatically qualify for a race and must beat a certain time limit to advance the story line. There is a free mode, password mode and scenario mode which plays like a Japanese anime movie. In the scenario mode, the object is to guide an up and coming driver to the ultimate victory. Quitting once means game over.
