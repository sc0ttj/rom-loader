The Classic Edition is a project by me, Con, which turns BS Zelda into a "real" Legend of Zelda. You will play with classic characters, Link and Zelda, have Triforce Symbols instead of crosses and... play without the BS-X Timer!

I called this project "The Legend of Zelda - Third Quest", because it can be regarded as a third quest to LoZ, Nes without any canon problems.

The core of this project is a time patch by Dreamer_Nom which disables the timer, hides it and forwards the game triforce related. Unfortunately DN left this patch inperfect, before he disappeared: the blue candle was never shop equipment (this problem occured due to Roto's patch) and the whirlpool didn't vanish after Dungeon 4, what happened because of a wrong time setting.

I waited 2 years to find a qualified hacker to solve these problems, but since nobody was able or interested I took the project in my own hands and started from point zero getting through the djungle of ASM hacking... and with the help of Tre and others I am proud and lucky to tell you that my mission is accomplished.
