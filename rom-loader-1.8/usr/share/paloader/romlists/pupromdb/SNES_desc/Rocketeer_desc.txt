"About as fun as a root canal"

One of those typical Disney videogames with the exception of decent graphics and sound. This game plain and simple stinks. The stages are either incredibly easy or extremely difficult so there is no balance and the story is more difficult to understand than one of those bums who ask you for ''fiddy cent'' when you are in the ghetto.

Story: 1/10 - I never saw the movie, and after playing the game, I still have no idea what the hell happened. All you can piece from the game is that there is a plane race that you have to win, you have to fly through the sky and avoid paratroopers, and you have to fight on a Zepplin at some point. Most pornfilms have better plots than this game (and probably the movie too).

Gameplay: 1/10 - The gameplay is horrid for the most part. In the first stage, it is nearly impossible to navigate your plane around the poles unless you look at the much smaller screen in the bottom. Why is there a 3-D enviroment on a 2-D screen? Makes about as much sense getting locked in the bathroom and peeing your pants. The worst part is the fist fight at the end, in which you basically have nothing else in your arsenal than a simple punch. If the Rocketeer had to fight someone who had a kick or two in their arsenal, he'd get worked.

Sound: 3/10 - Not bad, but not great either. For an SNES game it is decent. Not much you can say about the sound though since it's not memorable and there are no special sound effects.

Graphics: 4/10 - Decent graphics at best. You can make out the figures and all, but the backgrounds are nothing spectacular, which is not a good thing since most games take the time to make the background pleasing to your eyes. To put it bluntly, I've Gameboy games with nicer backgrounds.

Replay Value: 1/10 - Getting rid of this game is actually more fun than playing the game, trust me. You will be delightfully amused at throwing away the cartridge or tossing the ROM in the recycling bin.

Final Thought: I remember getting this game as a birthday gift quite some time ago, I also remember selling the game back to the same guy (Sam Pai) who gave it to me about a week later. It was probably the best 2 dollars I ever spent in my life.
