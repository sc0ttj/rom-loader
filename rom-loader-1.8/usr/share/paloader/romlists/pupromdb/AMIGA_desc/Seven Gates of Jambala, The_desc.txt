For such a young company, Thalion have done themselves proud by programming a slick and well polished game with small but well-defined sprites, haunting soundtracks and impressive presentation screens. The game's atmosphere veers wildly, due to the contrasting tunes and graphic styles - from the cute "Wizard of Oz" town scenes, through wondrous gold treasure caverns to murky underground passages filled with horrible monsters. Some of the dungeon creatures offering bargains are a little quirky, but fit into the general appearance of the game nicely nonetheless. A good start for these young designers! Seven Gates of Jambala continues the tradition - not to quite as good effect as USG but admirably enough - and manages to hold its own against the current glut of coin-op conversions. If you like a bit of wizardry and fancy a change from 3D racing or alien blasting then give Jambala a try.
