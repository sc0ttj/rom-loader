From Drewseph's site:

Metroid: Redesign is a total overhaul of Super Metroid by Drewseph with major coding done by Kejardon, MathOnNapkins and Jathys. The Planet Zebes, now bigger than we've previously seen it, is filled with many mysteries. Sleeping within the depths of the planet is a secret heavily protected by the last standing symbols of the great Chozo race?

New Features:

- Physics Changes
- New Items
- Abilities
