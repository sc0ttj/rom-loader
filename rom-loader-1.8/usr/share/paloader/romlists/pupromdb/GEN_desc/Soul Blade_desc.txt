I find it hard to say much about this game. I have only found it floating around the web as a ROM  and one buggy as hell at that! When flashed to a cartridge or when started up in Kega Fusion, the game kept freezing. I only got it to work using GenS, and even then it didn't run properly, constantly producing a number of very strange errors (opponent freezing in one place, characters turning into a mass of jumbled pixels, or hurting yourself by hitting any button!). Also, even if you're able to control the characters, these controls hardly work at all. In short, the Genesis Soul Edge  is totally unplayable!

Which is a real shame, because it looks very nice; the graphics are colorful, and the sprites are nicely drawn. Also, the ROM indicates that this would be a 32-bit game, which is pretty rare as far as pirates go. But the only version of the game I've found is buggy and incomplete, so unless someone can point out an actual working version of that game to me, I'll strongly advise against getting this game. It will only drive you mad!
