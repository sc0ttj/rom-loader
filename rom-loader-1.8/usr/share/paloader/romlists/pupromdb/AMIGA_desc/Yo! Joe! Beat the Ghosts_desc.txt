Graffiti artists live a hard life. Joe and Nat are always on the run, trying to escape New York's police. When they reach a mysterious castle, there's no way of knowing they're in deep trouble already.

The game itself is a platform game, featuring two characters. The protagonists can jump, crawl, kick, beat, slide, swim. They're even able to hold their breath when under water. If you're playing the game solely, "Joe" is your character of choice. A friend can take on Nat's part at the same PC. 

The purpose of "Yo! Joe!" is to get rid of "Professor X", who is the bad guy. The players can attack opponents using several weapons, including molotovs, chainsaws and nunchakus. 

The game doesn't offer save games, nor a highscore list. The copy protection requires the original disk at every start-up.
