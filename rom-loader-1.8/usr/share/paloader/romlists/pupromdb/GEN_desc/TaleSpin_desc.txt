The prize: a lucrative air-transport contract and glory for all! Fly in the face of adversity as you compete against Shere Khan. Fend off lowdown high-altitude strikes by Air Pirate Don Karnage. This airborne bully will stop at nothing to see you fail! You've got non-stop ground action, too. Leap quagmires, ford rivers, and swing from vines through a treacherous jungle. So strap on your goggles, and hang on for dear life as you soar into the wildest adventure in aviation history!
