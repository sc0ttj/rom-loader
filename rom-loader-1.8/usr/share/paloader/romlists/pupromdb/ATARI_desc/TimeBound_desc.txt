Poor Anacront!  He fiddled once too often with your time machine and fell in!  Now he's tumbling through history, timebound, and only you can save him!

There's no time to lose.  Leap right in and zoom through the eons.  Use your scanner to snare events between the years 2000 and 1.  As you travel, you'll gain glimpses of history, and move ever closer to Anacron!

You'll need to think and act fast to catch those events, and to hear if Anacron is near:  The sooner you discover where you stand in time, the better you'll be able to plan when to fly forward into the future or whiz back into the past.  The more you play Timebound, the more tangled Anacron's route will be, so you'll become timewise in no time at all!

Timebound is a unique self-pace journey in creative exploration.  It can be played for its exciting action or for the timely adventure it provides in social studies, science and history.  Easy to learn, with lively graphics and eleven skill levels, Timebound lets players make new discoveries with each new game!
