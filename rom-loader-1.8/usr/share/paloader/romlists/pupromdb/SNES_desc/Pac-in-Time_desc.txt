The evil Ghost Witch has cast a vicious spell on Pac-Man and thrown him back in time to when he was a Pac-Boy. Only you can save him now. Down some Pac-Pellets and get ready to battle your way through a totally supersonic side-scrolling adventure. Journey through snowy mountains and forests, collect fireballs and bubbles, crush Pac-Bats and ghosts, swim like a fish and swing like a monkey...and ultimately get Pac-Man back to the real world!
