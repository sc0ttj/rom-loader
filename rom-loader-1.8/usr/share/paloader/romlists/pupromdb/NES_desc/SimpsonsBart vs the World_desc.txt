Apparently Krusty the Clown and Montgomery Burns have teamed up to sponsor an art contest. The winner gets to take a treasure hunt around the world to collect cool Krusty merchandise. And of course, who is chosen as the winner but our little hero, Bart Simpson. But Mr. Burns's plans aren't on the level. He wants to use this chance to wipe out Bart and his family once and for all! So take a trip around the world with the Simpsons, find the treasure, and avoid being wasted by Burn's creepy cousins in foreign lands.
