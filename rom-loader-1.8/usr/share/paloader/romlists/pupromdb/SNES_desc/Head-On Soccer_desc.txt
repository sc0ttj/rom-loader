Fever Pitch Soccer (in North America, Head-On Soccer) is a football video game developed by US Gold. It was released in 1995 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Mega Drive, and Atari Jaguar consoles. It is a slapstick game in which the player tends to have to lean towards "dirty" play, special player abilities include the ability to dive in an attempt to win a free-kick or penalty. There are two gameplay modes; tournament and exhibition. A password is given out following the successful completion of each game in the tournament so that play can be resumed at a later point.
