Holy Neanderthal! There's big trouble in the Rock cavehold. Chubby-hubby Chuck was spending a typical Sunday afternoon guzzling down a case of Boulder root beer in front of the boob tube when all of a sudden he heard his lovely Ophelia grunt for help. Lifting his great gut off the stone couch, Chuck ran to the garden to find his curvaceous cave-babe nowhere in sight. She had been kidnapped. And judging from the size of the footprints on the terra firma, Ophelia's old flame, gruesome Gary Gritter, is the Cro Magnon responsible for this prehistoric tragedy.

Needless to say, Chuck has gone ape! And he's got a brontosaurus-sized bone to pick with the pebble-chewing wife-snatcher.

But first, in order to reach his B.C. bride, Chuck must belly-butt his way through five wild and woolly levels. He's got to tough some treacherous terrain and brave some savage creatures... survive another Ice Age... bob and body-surf through a dangerous water world... and face the terrors of a dinosaur boneyard.

O.K. Chuck. Let's rock!!!

Hints:

- Level Skip -
On the title screen, press: A B right A C A down A B right A
If done correctly, the caveman second to the right will grin. Now, start the game, enter the first level, and press and hold A+B+C, all together. Release, hold down A, and press up. You'll skip to the next level, and you can perform the ''hold A press up'' code again to skip multiple levels if you wish.
