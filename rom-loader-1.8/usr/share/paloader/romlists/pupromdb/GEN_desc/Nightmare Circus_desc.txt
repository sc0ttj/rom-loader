Nightmare Circus is a beat'em-up mixed with elements from platform games and fighting games, made for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. The hero, Raven, is trying to put an end to the nightmarish circus that only appears on stormy nights. He has to fight twisted and warped circus denizens through a variation of deadly circus levels.
