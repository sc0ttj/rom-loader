Translated as Woody Woodpecker's Frustration Vacation

This is a totally TecToy developed and released game, designed, coded and released in Brazil.. it was also converted to MegaDrive (Genesis). It's actually quite a fun game, if a tiny bit reminiscent of a lot of other platform games, but you will manage to extract some fun from it.
